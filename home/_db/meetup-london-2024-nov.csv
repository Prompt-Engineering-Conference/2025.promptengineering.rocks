But at some point, DevOps outgrew this simple coming together, and so we combined other functions to get terms like ‘DevSecOps’, ‘DataOps’, ‘MLOps’ and so on. All these terms are, however, too simplistic to capture the actual essence of DevOps and the ways of working that have developed around it.

However, there is no reason that these principles should only be applied to the development and operation of digital products and services. They can actually be applied across organisations as a whole to create ‘The DevOps Organisation’.

This talk explores how DevOps principles can be taken and applied outside of the context of software development to provide better outcomes, both internally, and externally, for an organisation.",,"Mark has over 15 years experience in software engineering, working across the SDLC starting out as a software engineer and later transitioning into DevOps and Cloud focused roles.
