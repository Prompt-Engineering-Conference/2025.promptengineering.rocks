It’s powerful stuff … but when you combine it with observability (the ability to understand the inner workings of your complex systems and other unknown-unknowns), what you get is a supercharged, superpowered version of both.
With observability and feature flags, you and your teams get deep technical and business insights in real time about how your code is working, what changed with your last deploy, and how changes are impacting different users, apps, or groups.",,,,

The SRE game provides a safe environment to start experimenting with SRE. In the game, you will be challenged to advise an organization on increasing its reliability. Like in real life, you should balance the quality of the system with the number of features you deliver. Of course, incidents occur, and your success depends on the decisions you made. We will start the workshop with a short keynote. The keynote introduces you to the core concepts of the SRE game and practical tips on getting started. After the keynote, we will play the SRE game.
During the SRE game, you need to help a fictive organization increase the reliability of its systems without stopping to deliver new features.
After the game, we will reflect on the teams' performance and explain the optimal strategy to help the fictive organization. We will close the session with a small prize ceremony providing the winning team and the runner-up a small prize.",,,,

But by framing incidents and post-incident reviews as customer empathy-building opportunities, we can facilitate more creative technical problem-solving, unlock improvements to your response process, and enable organizational agility that otherwise might have gone unnoticed.
This workshop will deliver actionable methods to increase customer empathy before, during, and after an incident. Attendees will learn how reframing incidents and post-incident reviews around the customer inspires more creative problem-solving and drives superior experiences for customers; and how deeper relationships between responding groups creates organizational gold.",,,,

https://youtu.be/SJ-tQhiZRNU?feature=shared,confirmed,Henrik Rexed,day1,1,Dynatrace,Henrik Rexed.png,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrexed/,,The Freedom of Kubernetes requires Chaos Engineering to shine in production,"Like any other technology transformation, k8s adoption typically starts with small “pet projects”. One k8s cluster here, another one over there. If you don’t pay attention, you may end up like many organizations these days, something that spreads like wildfire: hundreds or thousands of k8s clusters, owned by different teams, spread across on-premises and in the cloud, some shared, some very isolated.
When we start building application for k8s, we often lose sight of the larger picture on where it would be deployed and more over what the technical constraints of our targeted environment are.
Sometimes, we even think that k8s is that magician that will make all our hardware constraints disappear.
In reality, Kubernetes requires you to define quotas on nodes, namespaces, resource limits on our pods to make sure that your workload will be reliable. In case of heavy pressure, k8s will evict pods to remove pressure on your nodes, but eviction could have a significant impact on your end-users.
How can we proactively test our settings and measure the impact of k8s events to our users? The simple answer to this question is chaos Engineering.",@Hrexed,,,

Now what? The post-incident world often looks different to the one before. What next?
We’ve heard of post-mortem documents and incident review meetings but are they successful? Did we figure out the root cause or just cure the effects? Have we made things more brittle in the process? Might we have to repeat the steps in a month or three?

However, translating these advantages into bottom-line benefits often comes from combining technical change with social change - we must not just change the technology, but also rewrite the rules governing how that technology is used.
We are seeing growing thought leadership moving into this sociotechnical space: SRE, Data Mesh, DevOps and Platform Engineering are equally about the technology as they are about the rethinking of how teams are designed and organised.
In this talk we hope to help you understand how to apply this sociotechnical thinking to your organisation, so you unlock the - often untapped - bottom-line benefits of technical change.",,,,
