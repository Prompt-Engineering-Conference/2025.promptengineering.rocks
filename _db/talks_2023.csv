It’s unplanned, sometimes chaotic, and often stressful. It should be getting better, but many organizations find improving difficult and often backslide into bad practices. Teams tackling too many incidents see more burnout and have less time to work on work that impacts the bottom line.
Getting better at handling incidents takes practice and resources, changes to culture as well as improvements to tooling. We want to prioritize the most important issues, the problems that impact users, while delegating lower priority issues to automation. In the long term, reducing the number of incidents that responders have to deal with will improve team engagement, reduce burnout, and recapture time to spend on more important tasks.
In this talk, we’ll cover a number of methods that will have a positive impact on incident response, from crafting alerts, to writing automation, to setting good practices to prevent frustration among your team",,,,lnxchk,,,,,,,

How to address the challenge of uncertainty, complexity, and dynamism in the cloud and mitigate 3 risks: value,cost and failure by applying evolutionary system design, continuous optimizations, iterative simulations and empirical learning through use of datascience","An Accenture survey conducted in 2020 found that just 37% of companies had fully achieved their expected full value and outcomes from Cloud. Engineering Cloud applications to specific business-aligned technical capabilities to achieve higher order value is hard. Cloud being distributed, asynchronous, event and message-driven, presents a high degree of uncertainty and variability during design and runtime. Engineering Cloud applications for success involves complex tradeoffs, careful optimizations, making choices against constraints, and resolving conflicts between competing technical specifications. The very characteristics of Cloud that give immense benefits are also likely to give rise to the risk of sub-optimal outcomes if not engineered for expected business outcomes. While commitment to cloud is promising, there is more to do to get to full value. Companies have picked the low hanging fruit. Now they’re moving more complex and business-critical workloads that yield higher order value, while simultaneously learning how to embrace cloud as the operating system of the enterprise.
How to address the challenge of ensuring full business value from Cloud implementations?
Cloud Fitness Engineering:
Cloud Fitness Engineering (CFE) is a new way of architecting for the cloud. The goal of CFE is to ensure that the technical capabilities of the applications match the desired business outcomes. It addresses the challenges of uncertainty, complexity, and dynamism in the cloud environment by applying evolutionary system design, continuous optimizations, iterative simulations, and empirical learning.
CFE mitigates the three risks inherent in any Cloud program.

Join us to learn how to build & manage SLOs to prevent customer SLAs from being breached. As a SRE, it's crucial to break down those barriers & communicate effectively.","The ability to handle Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is critical in today's fast-paced business world. For our organisation, the challenge lies in managing millions of conversations between employees and banks, each with their own unique ID. We have an internal process that takes these IDs through a sequence of steps, with each step having its own processing state, until the final state is achieved. Once this happens, the ID is marked as complete and made visible to customers through our user interface. Each of the step has a respective individual team working on the functionalities such as the Capture team, Indexing team, Archive Insights team, Ingestion team, etc.
Our SLA with customers mandates that IDs must reach the final state within 3 days of being received. While 99% of the IDs move through the process smoothly, about 1% of them encounter various issues such as indexing, fatal errors, or XML parsing errors, which prevent them from reaching the final state. Our SRE team has developed an internal app based on Python FastAPI, Celery & mongo db that automates the verification of ID states and ensures that they are moved to the final state within the SLA timeframe. This app is bundled with the following scripts which are executed in the celery worker threads as cronjobs:
Script that runs daily, verifies the states of the IDs received for t-3 days. It then moves the IDs which are not in the final state into a static collection into Mongo DB.
Another script periodically verifies and updates the latest states of these IDs, and removes them if they have reached the final state. This script also takes care of updating the latest states of the id’s which were moved into the collection the previous days.
An auto-remediation script that kicks in at regular intervals, which retries the failed IDs by invoking the respective team's internal API.
Finally, another script that runs daily which creates an incident with the remaining failed ids using the Atlassian Jira API. As soon as the incidents are created alerts are sent to the respective teams informing the status of the failed IDs. The teams are notified about the incident via slack teams, emails enabling them to act promptly and address the issues before the SLAs are broken.
Furthermore, all of these scripts have been designed to ensure there is no manual toil involved, which automatically triggers the respective application functionality through internal APIs and creates JIRA incidents to inform the teams about the actual failures left over after the retry functionality. This efficient process ensures that the teams can act upon the failed IDs promptly, way before the SLOs are broken, thereby delivering a seamless experience to our customers.
Additionally, visibility to the customer as we navigate through reconciling every ID is crucial for transparency, customer confidence, and progress tracking.
By leveraging the technology, the SRE team has developed an efficient and reliable system for managing the processing of millions of IDs, thereby ensuring that customer SLAs are met consistently. The system's ability to automatically detect and alert teams of any failed IDs has helped the teams to proactively address issues and prevent potential SLA breaches, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and retention. This method not only allows us to meet our customer expectations, but also enables us to continuously improve our processes to ensure that we consistently deliver quality service.

Tired of provisioning resources that lead to unnecessary costs? The Keptn's Metric Server solves this by exposing new metrics in K8s. Join me to see how to scale workloads with efficient HPA rules.,"Have you ever faced the challenge of limited accessibility to observability data for Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) or are you tired of provisioning resources that lead to unnecessary costs? As you likely know, HPA leverages metrics exposed by the Kubernetes Metrics API for scaling decisions. Consequently, many organizations typically construct their autoscaling rules based on fundamental metrics like CPU and memory usage.
In Kubernetes, creating an autoscaling rule that guarantees both the reliability of applications and the cost efficiency only based on CPU usage can be challenging. As organizations expand their Kubernetes footprint, they often utilize more than one observability tool or switch tools altogether. How can we effectively utilize our observability data in autoscaling rules?
The Keptn project offers the Metric Server, which addresses this challenge by seamlessly consolidating all observability data within Kubernetes. Join us for an informative presentation where we will demonstrate how the Keptn Metrics Server effortlessly scrapes metrics, facilitating the autoscaling of Kubernetes workloads in conjunction with the HorizontalPodAutoscaler. Through a real example showcasing inefficient HPA rules, we will explain how the Keptn Metric Server can enhance and optimize the autoscaling process utilizing metrics from Istio/Envoy, but also the cost of your workload. Discover the value of the Keptn Metrics Operator, which serves as a unified entry point for metrics data, regardless of its source.

But it only got us so far. It's time we enter the next phase of the DevOps evolution, to continue streamlining our engineering operations, we need to rethink our processes & eliminate the amounting friction.","When DevOps first started to manifest over a decade ago, a lot of the focus was on streamlining engineering, much in the same way as assembly lines. Starting with the most repetitive and automatable processes, we created pipelines for continuous operations––testing, integration and deployment (AKA CI/CD). Concepts were borrowed from Kaizen (Japanese assembly lines) to ensure these processes flowed and worked, and it’s hard to imagine ever going back on the process and quality improvements brought on by CI/CD. But it only got us so far.
After solving for automation of programs - tests, integrations, builds and deploys are all basically scripts - our attention can turn to much heavier sources of friction, which are also harder to automate. These are the touch points between humans: pickup time for code reviews, who do I even assign this review to?!, what do I need to line up to get this PR merged? And between humans and programs: flaky builds and tests, builds + tests that take too long, post-deployment ownership during outages, synchronizing access to dev environments, and much more.

Developing tools for testing on production, like canary releases, traffic shadowing and beta testing help deliver new features and as a result, money, faster.","In the fast-paced world of agile software development, efficiency and speed are key factors to success. Regression testing, while a powerful tool, may not always be the most practical solution in such environments. While this form of testing has traditionally been used to identify defects and issues with software, the process can be slow, expensive, and can impede development teams from experimenting with new code on production.
For these reasons, many organizations have shifted their focus towards developing tools and environments that support testing on production. By leveraging tools like canary releases, shadowing traffic, and beta testing, developers can collect sufficient data points to ensure that a release is stable without the need for regression testing. These tools allow for more streamlined and efficient feedback on code changes, enabling engineers to experiment with new code and quickly identify and address any issues that may arise.
Canary releases, for example, allow developers to test new code changes with a small percentage of users before rolling out changes to the entire user base. Shadowing traffic involves sending a copy of the user’s traffic to a secondary system to test and compare new code changes. Beta testing allows developers to release new features to a select group of users for testing and feedback.
By implementing these tools and environments, developers can reduce the need for manual regression testing, which can be cumbersome, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. Furthermore, these tools can provide valuable insights into how new code changes will impact user experience and help teams make informed decisions about releasing new features and updates.
In conclusion, while regression testing has traditionally been a staple of software development, it may not always be the most practical solution in high-paced agile environments. By leveraging tools and environments that support testing on production, developers can reduce costs, speed up development cycles, and deliver higher-quality software to users.","Berlin, Germany","Valentin is a quality assurance wizard, with over a decade of experience in the fast-paced world of extreme scrum and agile environments.

With metrics, inevitably, you hit High cardinality problems. While searching for profound insights from their systems, we often face restrictions due to the cardinality limitations of the observability tools.

We will delve into the anatomy of a metric and issues that high cardinality can help resolve, from combating Noisy Neighbors to battling in the Streaming Wars and dealing with the pulse of High Cardinality.
However, modern systems' limitations make cardinality an unsolved problem. To find the best solution for cardinality, it is crucial to understand the Metric Lifecycle. Lastly, we will define workflows that enable scaling cardinality to millions, not just thousands.

But what can you do as a developer to avoid being the bad guy? How can project leads enable their teams to reduce the occurrence of broken builds?
In talking within our own teams, we discovered that many developers weren’t running sufficient integration and End to End tests in their local environments because it’s too difficult to set up and administer test environments in an efficient way.
That’s why we decided to rethink our entire local testing process in hopes of cutting down on the headaches and valuable time wasted. Enter Kuttl. Connecting Kuttl to CI builds has empowered our developers to easily configure a development environment locally that accurately matches the final test environment — without needing to become an expert CI admin themselves.
These days, we hear, “Who broke the build?” far less often — and you can too!

Join us as we share our journey of building a highly available and fault-tolerant caching solution while leveraging automation to achieve a faster MTTR.,"Payment systems that support real-time transaction processing are expected to be available and highly responsive 24/7/365. These systems must be fault-tolerant and highly resilient to any failures that might happen during payment transaction processing.
Building a low-latency payment system that spans multiple geographic locations requires a distributed caching solution for low latency and high-throughput data access. While building a real-time transaction processing system at Discover - one that is continuously available and can process thousands of transactions per second with a sub-second response time - we decided to introduce distributed caching technology into our architecture to minimize the latency and to replicate the data across multiple data centers. This presented numerous challenges:
•	How to run Active-Active cache clusters in multiple deployment regions with high-availability
•	How to auto-heal cache cluster failures due to network partitioning or disaster
•	How to automatically failover client applications in response to failures
•	How to automatically recover failed clusters to reduce MTTR
•	How to ensure data consistency after the cluster is recovered
•	How to implement a real-time monitoring and alerting solution for client and cluster connectivity
In this talk, we will take you through our journey of how we built a distributed caching solution to solve the challenges we faced.
•	Configuration-driven and thread-safe smart client solution that can intelligently detect failures
•	Ability for the client application to failover if the error rate is above a certain threshold
•	Automation to recover failed cluster and failback client connections after the cluster is recovered
•	Workflow automation for data consistency after the cluster is recovered

I'll lay out the general methodology of what encompasses a GameDay and compare & contract these different GameDay types.","### Introduction
I'll start off with a shared definition of Chaos Engineering (""the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.), provide brief context on why it's important. and expand on how this talk is about operating GameDays at different levels of a technical organization. ### Designing & Running an Experiment
This section will cover the general methodology of running an experiment. #### Step 1: Lay out assumptions
- We are constantly observing our systems. Every time we contribute to our codebases, debug a production failure, use our observability tools, etc. we’re building up our mental model for how our systems work. Over time, assumptions get built into that mental model. Sometimes these assumptions are accurate, but when they’re not, this leads to production incidents. - The best way to form a chaos engineering experiment is to ask the question, “what would happen if…?” and answer that question(s) with explanations as to why. The answers to these questions are your assumptions. #### Step 2: Define your priorities
- Given the laid out assumptions, I'll talk about how prioritization of which assumption to test first is important. I'll reference this Gremlin article [here](https://www.gremlin.com/community/tutorials/chaos-engineering-the-history-principles-and-practice/#which-chaos-engineering-experiments-do-you-perform-first). #### Step 3: Define experiment scenarios & tools
- I'll talk about how once an assumption is identified as highest priority, an accompanying plan will need to be tested, including details like hat scenario(s) would reproduce the questions you asked to define assumptions and which tool(s) will enable you to do that in a safe way. #### Step 4: Define your steady-state hypothesis
- I'll talk about the prereq of being able to define a steady state for a system so that you can measure impact of the experiment. #### Step 5: Finalize Experiment details
- By the end of this step, I'll review an example chaos engineering experiment template and highlight which final details needed to be completed, including: * Timeline/Agenda: When are you running the experiment? If there are multiple scenarios to be executed, what’s the ordering? When will the post-mortem be conducted? - Experiment roles - who will be doing what during the actual experiment? (List of roles can be found here)
#### Step 6: Run the experiment! I'll talk about what the actual experiment time should look like (including how it should resemble an actual production incident)
#### Step 7: Post-Mortem
- I'll talk about how even if the experiment runs perfectly smoothly, you should take the time to evaluate the outcome of the experiment and answer where and how we were right or wrong with our steady-state hypotheses. Much like typical incident reviews, there should also be a focus on determining root cause. This includes answering questions like, * How did the experiment scenarios impact our steady-state criteria? Did they impact them in the way I thought?
* Was there impact on our systems we didn’t foresee? Why was that?
#### Step 8: Action Items
Again, similar to incident reviews, action items should be stated clearly and assigned owners.
### Different GameDay Flavors
#### Team-specific GameDays
Starting off with a GameDay can be daunting, especially if the desire is to host one that is org-wide. While org-wide GameDays are a good long-term goal, there's no shame in starting smaller. I'll talk about how team GameDays can be used to test the process you've formulated and good recommend starting points for teams conducting their first GameDay. #### Org-wide GameDays
I'll cover my approach to org-wide GameDays, which happens in three parts over the course of 1 day:
1. Pre-Mortem: Pre-mortems are when you hypothesize what will happen when you run the experiment. This is done to test your existing mental models, which is why it should take place in a group setting. During the pre-mortem, the group should be answering questions like, how do you expect your services to perform? What impact on UX are you expecting? What impact on downstream or upstream services do you expect? etc. 2. Pre-mortems can be done during the actual GameDay, or separately, but they should be done by the same folks executing the experiment. 3. Actual Experiment: The actual execution of the experiment. 4. Post-Mortem: Similar to normal post-mortems for incidents, we want to make the experiment actionable by talking about what vulnerabilities we might have uncovered. We want to learn about where our mental models went wrong and how can we use these learnings to redefine what we once thought we knew.
I'll also talk about effective ownership & collaboration models here.","New York, NY","Lesley Cordero is currently a Staff Software Engineer, Tech Lead at The New York Times.
