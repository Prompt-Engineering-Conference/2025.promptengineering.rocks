How to address the challenge of uncertainty, complexity, and dynamism in the cloud and mitigate 3 risks: value,cost and failure by applying evolutionary system design, continuous optimizations, iterative simulations and empirical learning through use of datascience","An Accenture survey conducted in 2020 found that just 37% of companies had fully achieved their expected full value and outcomes from Cloud. Engineering Cloud applications to specific business-aligned technical capabilities to achieve higher order value is hard. Cloud being distributed, asynchronous, event and message-driven, presents a high degree of uncertainty and variability during design and runtime. 

Engineering Cloud applications for success involves complex tradeoffs, careful optimizations, making choices against constraints, and resolving conflicts between competing technical specifications. The very characteristics of Cloud that give immense benefits are also likely to give rise to the risk of sub-optimal outcomes if not engineered for expected business outcomes.  

While commitment to cloud is promising, there is more to do to get to full value.  Companies have picked the low hanging fruit. Now they’re moving more complex and business-critical workloads that yield higher order value, while simultaneously learning how to embrace cloud as the operating system of the enterprise.

How to address the challenge of ensuring full business value from Cloud implementations?

 Cloud Fitness Engineering:

Cloud Fitness Engineering (CFE) is a new way of architecting for the cloud. The goal of CFE is to ensure that the technical capabilities of the applications match the desired business outcomes. It addresses the challenges of uncertainty, complexity, and dynamism in the cloud environment by applying evolutionary system design, continuous optimizations, iterative simulations, and empirical learning.

CFE mitigates the three risks inherent in any Cloud program.
 
1.	Value Risk: risk of not unlocking full value from Cloud.
2.	Failure Risk: risk of distributed system failures.
3.	Cost Risk: disproportionate consumption of Cloud resources not commensurate with value.

With a strong background in containerisation technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, as well as expertise in CI/CD tools like Azure DevOps and Jenkins, I am well-equipped to lead and mentor teams on SRE best practices.

At my current role at Smarsh, I designed and developed a new framework for SRE apps using Python's FastAPI, Celery, and Jinja2 modules, Redis, JavaScript, HTML, bundling all SRE scripts into a single web app. This resulted in reduction of manual toil and kept the SLA's in tact, and I was awarded with 'Lead by Example Award' for spearheading in designing & building this app. It's the same app that was discussed in the CFP.

In my previous role at Siemens, I played a major role in designing and building CI/CD pipelines, collaborating with architects and stakeholders, and majorly contributed in bringing the infrastructure cost down. One such instance is that I've optimised cloud infrastructure costs by $5000 per month, brought down third-party vendor licenses for cross browser & cross platform testing by automating the setup required using Selenium Grid & PowerShell scripts.

",,,Smarsh,Men's 2XL,,,,,"In today's fast-paced development landscape, meeting SLAs is crucial for any SaaS organisation to maintain a competitive edge. Join us to learn how to build & manage SLOs to prevent customer SLAs from being breached. As a SRE, it's crucial to break down those barriers & communicate effectively.","The ability to handle Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is critical in today's fast-paced business world. For our organisation, the challenge lies in managing millions of conversations between employees and banks, each with their own unique ID. We have an internal process that takes these IDs through a sequence of steps, with each step having its own processing state, until the final state is achieved. Once this happens, the ID is marked as complete and made visible to customers through our user interface. Each of the step has a respective individual team working on the functionalities such as the Capture team, Indexing team, Archive Insights team, Ingestion team, etc.
Our SLA with customers mandates that IDs must reach the final state within 3 days of being received. While 99% of the IDs move through the process smoothly, about 1% of them encounter various issues such as indexing, fatal errors, or XML parsing errors, which prevent them from reaching the final state. 
Our SRE team has developed an internal app based on Python FastAPI, Celery & mongo db that automates the verification of ID states and ensures that they are moved to the final state within the SLA timeframe. This app is bundled with the following scripts which are executed in the celery worker threads as cronjobs:
Script that runs daily, verifies the states of the IDs received for t-3 days. It then moves the IDs which are not in the final state into a static collection into Mongo DB.
Another script periodically verifies and updates the latest states of these IDs, and removes them if they have reached the final state. This script also takes care of updating the latest states of the id’s which were moved into the collection the previous days.
An auto-remediation script that kicks in at regular intervals, which retries the failed IDs by invoking the respective team's internal API.
Finally, another script that runs daily which creates an incident with the remaining failed ids using the Atlassian Jira API. As soon as the incidents are created alerts are sent to the respective teams informing the status of the failed IDs. The teams are notified about the incident via slack teams, emails enabling them to act promptly and address the issues before the SLAs are broken.
Furthermore, all of these scripts have been designed to ensure there is no manual toil involved, which automatically triggers the respective application functionality through internal APIs and creates JIRA incidents to inform the teams about the actual failures left over after the retry functionality. This efficient process ensures that the teams can act upon the failed IDs promptly, way before the SLOs are broken, thereby delivering a seamless experience to our customers.
Additionally, visibility to the customer as we navigate through reconciling every ID is crucial for transparency, customer confidence, and progress tracking.
By leveraging the technology, the SRE team has developed an efficient and reliable system for managing the processing of millions of IDs, thereby ensuring that customer SLAs are met consistently. The system's ability to automatically detect and alert teams of any failed IDs has helped the teams to proactively address issues and prevent potential SLA breaches, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and retention. This method not only allows us to meet our customer expectations, but also enables us to continuously improve our processes to ensure that we consistently deliver quality service.
 
Join us at ""Slaying the SLAs: Mastering Effective Communication for Seamless Customer Experience"" to learn more about how to handle SLAs and achieve operational excellence in your organisation.","As the lead Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) for our company, I have designed and built the said app from scratch that ensures our bank customers' SLAs are not breached.

But what can you do as a developer to avoid being the bad guy? How can project leads enable their teams to reduce the occurrence of broken builds?
In talking within our own teams, we discovered that many developers weren’t running sufficient integration and End to End tests in their local environments because it’s too difficult to set up and administer test environments in an efficient way.
That’s why we decided to rethink our entire local testing process in hopes of cutting down on the headaches and valuable time wasted. Enter Kuttl. Connecting Kuttl to CI builds has empowered our developers to easily configure a development environment locally that accurately matches the final test environment — without needing to become an expert CI admin themselves.
These days, we hear, “Who broke the build?” far less often — and you can too!

Session Outline:

","In this session, We’ll cover:
● A quick history of our testing challenges and what led us to Kuttl
● The benefits of our new testing approach — easy to configure and minimal investment
● How we combine Kuttl and CI pipelines for more streamlined testing and fewer broken builds

Session Key Takeaways:

1. When and why we decided to rethink our e2e testing practices and our subsequent discovery of Kuttl.
2. Why Kuttl has been the perfect tool for our developers to perform better local integration/e2e testing without the burden of becoming their own CI administrators.
3. A detailed account of how we utilize Kuttl to set up development environments locally that match our final test environment in order to reduce unnecessary commits and minimize CI build breaks.

With traditional support teams' adoption of SRE, we automate similar workflows with different tools. Let's use Synthetic Monitoring as E2E tests to validate the user experience together!","Despite the emergency of DevOps to unite development, support and SRE factions together using common processes, we still face cultural and tooling challenges that create the Dev and Ops silos. Specifically, we often use different tools to achieve similar testing: case in point validating the user experience in production using Synthetic Monitoring and in development using e2e testing.

By joining forces around common tooling, we can use the same tool for both production monitoring and testing within CI. In this talk, I will discuss how Synthetic Monitoring and e2e Testing are two sides of the same coin. Furthermore, I shall show how production monitoring and development testing can be achieved using Playwright, GitHub Actions and Elastic Synthetics.","## Background

Before joining Elastic as a Developer Advocate, I spent over 10 years building software in a large investment bank. At certain points in my career, part of my job involved either being first-line support or later working with support engineers with outages on the applications I built. I personally observed a divided culture between developers and operational support engineers. Sadly this is not limited to banking. 

Although the emergence of DevOps has emphasised the importance of combining forces, without a collaborative culture and collective responsibility the identification of issues can be thrown over the fence as we shift automated testing further left or right. Without collaboration, I found that developers would build e2e test suites to pick up defects earlier. However, operations engineers may also build similar tests on the production side using different tools.

## Audience Takeaways

I believe we can combine forces to have similar suites running both as part of CI pipelines and production monitoring by using similar tools. In this talk, I will take steps to break this divide by sharing ideas and challenges on how we can use common tools to share the load and develop these automated checks together. I intend to leave the audience with these key takeaways:

1. Sharing of the potential reasons for this cultural divide between development and support within technology organisations.
2. An overview of e2e testing and how it can be used to mimic, to some degree, the user experience.
3. Provide a definition of Synthetic Monitoring and the different types of monitors that can be applied to production software.
4. Sharing of examples of how common tools can be used to test the user journey in both development and production phases using Playwright and  Elastic Synthetics. The sample CI to bridge between developer and production environments will be demonstrated using GitHub Actions.
5. Discussion of key gotchas such as environment and secret configuration and test synchronisation that will be needed to ensure these e2e tests can be safely and securely used for production monitoring.

## Target Audience

Although my experience relates to financial systems, the lessons here are applicable to individuals working in development and operational roles. I believe the following individuals would be interested in this talk:

1. Developers interested in how automation tools such as Playwright can be used to validate the user experience as they build features.
2. DevOps and SRE engineers looking to use a common toolset for testing and production monitoring.
3. SREs that are keen to learn how they can collaborate more closely with development teams to identify suitable user journeys to monitor in production and receive alerts when defects appear in production that impede users from performing these steps.
4. Multi-discipline teams looking to receive notifications in production that features they have built are alive and well in their configured environments.",Beginner,"[""sre"", ""synthetic monitoring"", ""playwright""]","May 12, 2023 10:16 UTC",

Developing tools for testing on production, like canary releases, traffic shadowing and beta testing help deliver new features and as a result, money, faster.","In the fast-paced world of agile software development, efficiency and speed are key factors to success. Regression testing, while a powerful tool, may not always be the most practical solution in such environments. While this form of testing has traditionally been used to identify defects and issues with software, the process can be slow, expensive, and can impede development teams from experimenting with new code on production.

For these reasons, many organizations have shifted their focus towards developing tools and environments that support testing on production. By leveraging tools like canary releases, shadowing traffic, and beta testing, developers can collect sufficient data points to ensure that a release is stable without the need for regression testing. These tools allow for more streamlined and efficient feedback on code changes, enabling engineers to experiment with new code and quickly identify and address any issues that may arise.

Canary releases, for example, allow developers to test new code changes with a small percentage of users before rolling out changes to the entire user base. Shadowing traffic involves sending a copy of the user’s traffic to a secondary system to test and compare new code changes. Beta testing allows developers to release new features to a select group of users for testing and feedback.

By implementing these tools and environments, developers can reduce the need for manual regression testing, which can be cumbersome, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. Furthermore, these tools can provide valuable insights into how new code changes will impact user experience and help teams make informed decisions about releasing new features and updates.

In conclusion, while regression testing has traditionally been a staple of software development, it may not always be the most practical solution in high-paced agile environments.

From combating Noisy Neighbors to battling in the Streaming Wars and dealing with the pulse of High Cardinality, what are the best workflows to deal with it?","Observability relies on metrics as a crucial aspect, providing a cost-effective and speedy way to address queries regarding SDLC and Software health, which can otherwise be challenging.

With metrics, inevitably, you hit High cardinality problems. While searching for profound insights from their systems, we often face restrictions due to the cardinality limitations of the observability tools. But what makes high cardinality significant, and why is it an inevitable challenge when monitoring systems on a vast scale?

We will delve into the anatomy of a metric and issues that high cardinality can help resolve, from combating Noisy Neighbors to battling in the Streaming Wars and dealing with the pulse of High Cardinality.

However, modern systems' limitations make cardinality an unsolved problem. To find the best solution for cardinality, it is crucial to understand the Metric Lifecycle. Lastly, we will define workflows that enable scaling cardinality to millions, not just thousands.

When software is in production, it's crucial to have telemetry and instrumentation to troubleshoot issues. Unfortunately, this can be a time-consuming and costly 
process. Often, we resort to using generic solutions that may not address all the unique needs of our specific system. This can lead to missed opportunities for improvement and wasted time looking for answers elsewhere.

Ideally these will have a centralised way to handle authentication and authorization, but often they are built at different times for different needs, and can end up with their own separate auth. This then becomes tricky to manage cohesively when either breaking up a monolith, or handling identities consistently across a service-oriented architecture.

Whilst there are many approaches (all valid) to centralising auth, this talk looks at how existing legacy auth code can be abstracted out to a new service that can work in combination with an ingress gateway to provide a central place to enforce authentication and determine authorization. Content will include showing how allow/deny logic works, how auth information can be sent to downstream services, and how multiple auth mechanisms can be handled by a single auth service.","This talk is based off a project where we had to consolidate 4 auth mechanisms (all handled in different parts of our monolith codebase) to a central service as it was impacting our ability to move to a service-oriented architecture (microservice development was using the monolith as an auth proxy, which was a pain) so this was the approach that we took.

Starting with the most repetitive and automatable processes, we created pipelines for continuous operations––testing, integration and deployment (AKA CI/CD).

But it only got us so far.

After solving for automation of programs - tests, integrations, builds and deploys are all basically scripts - our attention can turn to much heavier sources of friction, which are also harder to automate. These are the touch points between humans: pickup time for code reviews, who do I even assign this review to?!, what do I need to line up to get this PR merged? And between humans and programs: flaky builds and tests, builds + tests that take too long, post-deployment ownership during outages, synchronizing access to dev environments, and much more.

He has spent the last 7 years on his SRE journey, doing every job from solo SRE to building and managing SRE teams to architecting and delivering cross company SRE focused projects.

He will happily discuss all of this with you over an oat milk flatwhite. ",isitvegan,,Dell Technologies,Men's L,,,,,"Over my last few jobs, I have been brought on as a senior SRE. Instead of wrangling CI/CD or messaging queues, I found my time was better spent introducing, or reintroducing the concepts of observability, incident & change management and other core SRE topics. SRE is a positive lever for culture.","In this presentation, I will describe life as a Staff SRE, and how it turned out to be different than what I was expecting. I will describe how I got started, how I made my initial impact and the scope of it. I will then describe how I make my current impact. Over time, I have learned that my most impactful moments weren't putting out fires or scaling one more service. My impact has been most positively felt by restructuring aging processes, educating engineers and driving consistency in attitude and sometimes tooling. All of this was driven by my SRE mindset, and my ability to win over the most ardent and stubborn engineers via data and in-house champions. I will describe real situations and how I overcame them. I will also describe where I fell short, and the best ways to avoid some of these pitfalls. In this talk, I will demonstrate to other SREs and engineers how they can make similar impacts, not by becoming a 10x engineer, but rather by channeling efforts that enable others to become 10x engineers.
","For the description, I would use different verbs when displaying it to attendees. Swapping learn to demonstrate, for example. And more focus on the attendee than the presenter.

In 2019, I gave my first public presentation to SRECon EMEA ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPR5yYSoPE ). It was all about how I got started as an SRE back in 2016. The content of my talk  was my trial by fire moment. After 7 years and 5 different organizations, I have learned how to utilize my strengths to the benefit of my organization. I've grown a lot since then. I don't think I would treat this talk as a sequel so much, but rather, as a way to demonstrate the broad impact SREs can have on an organization, regardless of size.

The energy in that video is also the energy I will bring to this talk. I regularly give internal presentations that receive positive feedback. I would love to share what I know with the attendees of this event.",All,"[""sre"", ""culture""]","May 30, 2023 21:42 UTC",

","## Who and Why?

Loading testing has always been the biggest technical challenge at any company that’s growing fast. There’s a common misconception that throwing money at the problem would solve everything but that’s not the case at all. I see three major concerns  
 
1. Fundamentally, building the architecture in databases, caching and job infrastructure must be done with a long term mindset that takes potential growth into account.  
2. Infrastructure scaling needs to be tested preemptively 
3. Lots of “unknown unknowns” have to be discovered BEFORE the actual load comes in(this has many parallels to catching a wave while surfing).

Also an overview of observability and monitoring in the context of MLOps and how it can be handled with Prometheus. We also bring in KubeEdge for monitoring on-edge devices.","MLOps is widely talked about and used to make the practice of deploying, managing, and monitoring ML models in production easier. Monitoring ML training or evaluation jobs is obviously very important however it is more important to monitor once an ML model is deployed.

This talk first starts by giving a gentle introduction about how ML deployments should be monitored, briefly talking about edge cases in production, data drift, concept drift, model metrics as well as the standard system and resource metrics. We give the audience an overview of observability and monitoring in the context of MLOps. This monitoring could also provide valuable results in terms of whether a model should be retrained, if more data should be collected, if different kinds of data should be collected, and more.

We show how one can handle the very important task of monitoring and performing the aforementioned tasks in the context of MLOps with Prometheus. We also show how one could take their existing deployments and add the power of easy and useful monitoring with Prometheus. Finally, we also show demos about how one could use Prometheus paired with their Flyte or Seldon Core, or FastAPI ML deployments.","## Audience

This talk would cater to the following audience:

- Machine Learning developers looking to integrate monitoring and observability
- Machine learning researchers looking to make the most out of their experiments

This talk would not only bring something new for the audience in terms of using Prometheus or observabiltiy for their Machine Learning workloads but paired with demos and simulations we would do in our talk make it easy for the audience to grasp the ideas.

## **Benefit for the ecosystem:**

We strongly believe this talk would go a long way in:

- Understand how MLOps needs monitoring in different context than other software systems
- Show what different kind of monitoring capabilities are often required for Machine Learning workloads
- Demonstrate how Prometheus can make the task of monitoring Machine learning throughout the MLOps process easy
- How these could be paired with standard monitoring of resources or systems that have been very widely done with Prometheus
- Make sense of the monitoring with Grafana or others tools
- Equip the audience so they could try out Prometheus for their MLOps lifecycle starting now with demos on using Flyte, Seldon Core and FastAPI",All,"[""prometheus"", ""machine-learning"", ""docker"", ""kubernetes"", ""kubedge""]","April 14, 2023 00:45 UTC",

Join us as we share our journey of building a highly available and fault-tolerant caching solution while leveraging automation to achieve a faster MTTR.,"Payment systems that support real-time transaction processing are expected to be available and highly responsive 24/7/365. These systems must be fault-tolerant and highly resilient to any failures that might happen during payment transaction processing.

Building a low-latency payment system that spans multiple geographic locations requires a distributed caching solution for low latency and high-throughput data access. While building a real-time transaction processing system at Discover - one that is continuously available and can process thousands of transactions per second with a sub-second response time - we decided to introduce distributed caching technology into our architecture to minimize the latency and to replicate the data across multiple data centers. This presented numerous challenges:

•	How to run Active-Active cache clusters in multiple deployment regions with high-availability
•	How to auto-heal cache cluster failures due to network partitioning or disaster
•	How to automatically failover client applications in response to failures
•	How to automatically recover failed clusters to reduce MTTR
•	How to ensure data consistency after the cluster is recovered
•	How to implement a real-time monitoring and alerting solution for client and cluster connectivity

In this talk, we will take you through our journey of how we built a distributed caching solution to solve the challenges we faced.

•	Configuration-driven and thread-safe smart client solution that can intelligently detect failures
•	Ability for the client application to failover if the error rate is above a certain threshold
•	Automation to recover failed cluster and failback client connections after the cluster is recovered
•	Workflow automation for data consistency after the cluster is recovered
•	Real-time streaming of client connectivity metrics
•	Observability solution to simplify operational support
","This talk is inspired by our previous challenges of supporting real-time business-critical applications that required manual procedures to recover from failures, which in turn impacted MTTR. Traditionally there has been a bigger organizational investment in building business capabilities, and we wanted to make a cultural shift by leveraging extreme automation to achieve operational excellence.",All,"[""Distributed Caching"", ""Resilient Systems"", ""Fault Tolerance"", ""highly available systems"", ""MTTR"", ""Automation""]","February 27, 2023 22:55 UTC",

",clesleycode,,The New York Times,Men's S,,,,,"This talk will focus on conducting GameDays at different levels of an organization: at the team level, product group level, and company-wide level. I'll lay out the general methodology of what encompasses a GameDay and compare & contract these different GameDay types.","### Introduction

I'll start off with a shared definition of Chaos Engineering (""the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.), provide brief context on why it's important. and expand on how this talk is about operating GameDays at different levels of a technical organization. 

### Designing & Running an Experiment

This section will cover the general methodology of running an experiment. 

#### Step 1: Lay out assumptions

- We are constantly observing our systems. Every time we contribute to our codebases, debug a production failure, use our observability tools, etc. we’re building up our mental model for how our systems work. Over time, assumptions get built into that mental model. Sometimes these assumptions are accurate, but when they’re not, this leads to production incidents. 

- The best way to form a chaos engineering experiment is to ask the question, “what would happen if…?” and answer that question(s) with explanations as to why. The answers to these questions are your assumptions. 

#### Step 2: Define your priorities

- Given the laid out assumptions, I'll talk about how prioritization of which assumption to test first is important. I'll reference this Gremlin article [here](https://www.gremlin.com/community/tutorials/chaos-engineering-the-history-principles-and-practice/#which-chaos-engineering-experiments-do-you-perform-first). 

#### Step 3: Define experiment scenarios & tools

- I'll talk about how once an assumption is identified as highest priority, an accompanying plan will need to be tested, including details like hat scenario(s) would reproduce the questions you asked to define assumptions and which tool(s) will enable you to do that in a safe way. 

#### Step 4: Define your steady-state hypothesis

- I'll talk about the prereq of being able to define a steady state for a system so that you can measure impact of the experiment. 

#### Step 5: Finalize Experiment details

- By the end of this step, I'll review an example chaos engineering experiment template and highlight which final details needed to be completed, including: 

* Timeline/Agenda: When are you running the experiment? If there are multiple scenarios to be executed, what’s the ordering? When will the post-mortem be conducted? 
- Experiment roles - who will be doing what during the actual experiment? (List of roles can be found here)

#### Step 6: Run the experiment! 

I'll talk about what the actual experiment time should look like (including how it should resemble an actual production incident)

#### Step 7: Post-Mortem

- I'll talk about how even if the experiment runs perfectly smoothly, you should take the time to evaluate the outcome of the experiment and answer where and how we were right or wrong with our steady-state hypotheses. Much like typical incident reviews, there should also be a focus on determining root cause. This includes answering questions like, 

* How did the experiment scenarios impact our steady-state criteria? Did they impact them in the way I thought?
* Was there impact on our systems we didn’t foresee? Why was that?

#### Step 8: Action Items

Again, similar to incident reviews, action items should be stated clearly and assigned owners.

### Different GameDay Flavors

#### Team-specific GameDays

Starting off with a GameDay can be daunting, especially if the desire is to host one that is org-wide. While org-wide GameDays are a good long-term goal, there's no shame in starting smaller. I'll talk about how team GameDays can be used to test the process you've formulated and good recommend starting points for teams conducting their first GameDay. 

#### Org-wide GameDays

I'll cover my approach to org-wide GameDays, which happens in three parts over the course of 1 day:

1. Pre-Mortem: Pre-mortems are when you hypothesize what will happen when you run the experiment. This is done to test your existing mental models, which is why it should take place in a group setting. During the pre-mortem, the group should be answering questions like, how do you expect your services to perform? What impact on UX are you expecting? What impact on downstream or upstream services do you expect? etc. 
2. Pre-mortems can be done during the actual GameDay, or separately, but they should be done by the same folks executing the experiment. 
3. Actual Experiment: The actual execution of the experiment. 
4. Post-Mortem: Similar to normal post-mortems for incidents, we want to make the experiment actionable by talking about what vulnerabilities we might have uncovered. We want to learn about where our mental models went wrong and how can we use these learnings to redefine what we once thought we knew.

I'll also talk about effective ownership & collaboration models here.

Showcase the important of ephemeral resources in testing and cloud savings, and demo code for deploying a simple Go API on a k8s cluster, and then destroy it.","This presentation will cover how to create and deploy a simple Golang API to a GKE Cluster using only Terraform. We will deep dive into how to:

- Create, Dockerize, and publish a Go app that exposes an http endpoint
- Create a GKE Cluster using terraform
- Deploy containerized app using Kubernetes deployment and service
- Convert any used Kubernetes resources using terraform modules
- Test the exposed endpoint before and after destroying the resources.

Source code at https://github.com/Marwan01/automated-infra, and initial article at https://medium.com/google-cloud/deploy-a-go-api-to-google-kubernetes-engine-via-terraform-bb3eb7a479a4 ","I have worked with Golang as a developer for 3 years, before moving to an SRE role. I realized the importance of the dev team being able to understand how to containerize and orchestrate Go APIs. I realized the importance of simplifying dev tools to speed up pushing to production all while maintaining high availability, and high standards for running integration, unit tests, and load tests. Using ephemeral resources to do chaos engineering and load testing is cheap and convenient, and can be added to the CI/CD pipelines to make sure we are always doing the all the necessary testing. I created a series of articles that allows a user to fully automate the deployment of a full stack app, from a bigtable DB, all the way to a front end. and the code can be found at https://github.com/Marwan01/automated-infra. I want to demo it and focus on the Go API connection. I have been an SRE for 3 years, and came from a dev background rather than an ops background. I believe it is a point of view a lot of other developers would like to get insight on, and I would love to share this presentation with them and answer any questions.",Intermediate,"[""terraform"", ""kubernetes"", ""ephemeral"", ""iac"", ""api"", ""go"", ""golang""]","February 08, 2023 16:14 UTC",

Learn how the worlds of Cassandra and Kubernetes on the cloud collide in a remarkably cohesive multi-cloud including comparing and contrasting the approaches.","Although some of today’s cloud properties, like elasticity, scalability, self-healing, durability, DR, etc. seemed revolutionary during the pre-cloud days, Cassandra was born with many of these properties. With the ever growing popularity of Kubernetes, the k8ssandra open source project is intended to bring Cassandra's  advantages to the cloud and help simplify operations. 

The biggest challenge in the Kubernetes world today is multi-cloud. Although it is easy to conceptualize, it is hard to implement. Attend this session for a quick overview of open source projects Cassandra and k8ssandra . You will see how the worlds of Cassandra and Kubernetes on the cloud collide in a remarkably cohesive way to incorporate the best of both.

After attending this primarily demo driven session based on a mix of terraform and helm, attendees will walk away with a good understanding of the k8ssandra project and how it is evolving to support multi-region and multi-cloud based on the newly introduced k8ssandra operator. On EKS, we leverage EKS Kubefed. Along this journey we will look at one-off deployments on GKE, EKS including multi-cloud (GKE and EKS) and how to do day 2 operations with k8ssandra components.

They are to create company-specific platform to develop and deliver their products.

It requires a special abstraction level on top of Cloud provider (AWS, Azure etc.) and tooling (K8S, Terraform..), including specific app types (Express, Spring Boot, Flask etc.) and CI/CD pipelines (GitLab, Github) + observability and security enablement, to move the cognitive load from the product delivery teams.

Picking the right tooling, foster the culture, solution and approaches is complex, but there is a common set of patterns and tools, so this talk is to describe both the reasons why Platform Engineering is a must, and which tooling and approaches will help you to start.","Serg went from a developer and architect, to a Director, VP and Global Head of Product and Engineering, so has an understanding of the needs of both developers, business and customers.
