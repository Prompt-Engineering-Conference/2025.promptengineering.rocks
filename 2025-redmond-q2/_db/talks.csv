,confirmed,Andrew Suderman,1,1,Fairwinds,Andrew Suderman.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudermanjr/,,Case Study: Re-Thinking Our Infrastructure Tooling,"When you're managing dozens of Kubernetes clusters, across three different clouds, for dozens of individual companies in their own accounts, the challenge of (re)designing tooling is complex. Come hear how we worked through all the many possible options (centralized IaC vs templating, whether to use cluster managers like Rancher, etc.), what high-level tradeoffs were made (i.e. ease-of-use vs speed of changes vs centralized control), and the tangible outcomes of this process. The focus here will be on the process and decision making, given all the different drivers such as technology, business, people, process, etc. This talk will cover how we undertook the process, while giving you tangible next steps to take back to your desk.

From this talk, you'll take away: - Some reasons why you should or should not attempt a rewrite of your Infrastructure-as-Code process. - An overview of the inputs that you should consider when designing an Infrastructure-as-Code tooling stack. - Some idea of how to be successful with a tooling rewrite.",,,,"Andrew Suderman has had a lifelong obsession with technology that currently fuels his passion for Kubernetes. He enjoys designing and building new systems that make life easier for developers. Currently he pursues that passion at ReactiveOps, where he maintains dozens of clusters and works on internal tooling.

In his spare time he enjoys off-roading, camping, quadcopters, motorcycles, and far too many other hobbies to afford."

Learn how Identity-Aware Proxies transform service access from perimeter-based to continuous verification, explained through the universal experience of airport security.","Imagine if showing your ID once at airport security meant you could then board any plane, enter the cockpit, or walk into customs. Sounds absurd? Yet this is how perimeter-based security works - one check, then complete trust.  Based on Google's BeyondCorp papers, this talk breaks down Zero Trust and Identity-Aware Proxies, where every access request is verified based on identity, device, and context - just as airports verify your credentials at every secure checkpoint, from airport security to boarding gates to airline lounges. Through technical concepts and the analogy of airport security, we'll explore how to implement these principles in real-world applications.",@nickytonline,,"Nick is a developer advocate at Pomerium, a zero trust, identity-aware proxy platform that enables secure, clientless connections to web applications and services without a corporate VPN.

Discover methods to detect issues like pod delays and service dependencies, using clustering algorithms and proactive strategies for improved resilience and resource optimization.","Join us for a deep dive session that extracts data-driven observations and insights from heavily utilized clusters to find unique patterns that impact reliability.  We'll share how to implement the right signals to detect common challenges such as delays in pod spin-ups, pod termination data to identify workloads most affected by these terminations, or closely occurring failures that indicate hidden service dependencies. We'll then cover methods to preemptively address these to improve resilience using clustering algorithms like DBSCAN, for dependency mapping, and other good practices.  We'll walk through a typical journey from experimental setups using scripts and command-line outputs to production-ready practices––from quick prototyping, to refining data pipelines and optimizing performance for operational environments. By uncovering these hidden patterns & signals you can achieve proactive reliability improvements, for improved cluster health & optimization of resource allocation.",,,"Gary Edgar is a seasoned technical support and customer engineer with 15+ years of experience across cloud infrastructure, databases, and monitoring systems.

Following those guidelines is key to get reliably running business critical applications for your users or customers. 

But even after following all the guidelines, did you really know your applications would run as expected? With this session, I'm going to take the guesswork out of that question, and walk you through different tools in Azure, Azure Load Testing and Azure Chaos Studio, which help by stress-testing your critical workloads, running in App Services, Containers, CosmosDB or traditional Virtual Machines.

As usual in Peter's sessions, this will be packed with live demos and only a bare minimum of slides.
