,confirmed,Andrew Suderman,1,1,ReadyTalk,Andrew Suderman.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudermanjr/,,,,Case Study: Re-Thinking Our Infrastructure Tooling,"When you're managing dozens of Kubernetes clusters, across three different clouds, for dozens of individual companies in their own accounts, the challenge of (re)designing tooling is complex. Come hear how we worked through all the many possible options (centralized IaC vs templating, whether to use cluster managers like Rancher, etc.), what high-level tradeoffs were made (i.e. ease-of-use vs speed of changes vs centralized control), and the tangible outcomes of this process. The focus here will be on the process and decision making, given all the different drivers such as technology, business, people, process, etc. This talk will cover how we undertook the process, while giving you tangible next steps to take back to your desk.

From this talk, you'll take away: - Some reasons why you should or should not attempt a rewrite of your Infrastructure-as-Code process. - An overview of the inputs that you should consider when designing an Infrastructure-as-Code tooling stack. - Some idea of how to be successful with a tooling rewrite.",,"Andrew Suderman has had a lifelong obsession with technology that currently fuels his passion for Kubernetes. He enjoys designing and building new systems that make life easier for developers. Currently he pursues that passion at ReactiveOps, where he maintains dozens of clusters and works on internal tooling.

In his spare time he enjoys off-roading, camping, quadcopters, motorcycles, and far too many other hobbies to afford."
