It’s powerful stuff … but when you combine it with observability (the ability to understand the inner workings of your complex systems and other unknown-unknowns), what you get is a supercharged, superpowered version of both.
With observability and feature flags, you and your teams get deep technical and business insights in real time about how your code is working, what changed with your last deploy, and how changes are impacting different users, apps, or groups.",,

Contributing Authors receive royalties when the company's enterprise customers use their code to automate root cause analysis and remediation.","#### TL;DR
Hyperscale SRE teams don't use traditional runbooks. Instead, each team hooks in to a massive shared library of automated troubleshooting steps covering all layers of their infrastructure, platform and application dependencies. RunWhen is building a (paid) expert community to create an open source equivalent of these shared libraries, along with an enterprise AI platform that runs hundreds of automated troubleshooting steps in response to incoming alerts, questions, CI/CD jobs, etc. When an enterprise user imports automation from the RunWhen community, the original Author receives a royalty. This talk is for potential interested Authors.
#### Who is this for?
The RunWhen Authors program is an opportunity for SRE/PE/DevOps engineers who enjoy writing high quality automation for root cause analysis and remediation, or who simply want to learn about how hyperscale SRE teams think about their automation programs. In 2024, the RunWhen Authors program is focused primarily on the Kubernetes ecosystem -- underlying cloud infrastructure, platform, popular open source components (read: the top 100 Helm charts) and common application troubleshooting patterns.
#### What will we cover?
This talk will provide an overview of contributions to the library thus far, typical users of the library, how to spot a good potential contribution and the basics of structuring the automated steps in wrappers that the RunWhen platform can consume. We will go over some of the AI code authoring tools that the RunWhen team has written to make the process of creating high quality troubleshooting automation quickly. Several examples will be shown, along with links to learn more and pointers to hands-on workshops where attendees can write their first automated troubleshooting steps, publish them for the community and watch them executed by RunWhen AI Troubleshooting Assistants.","Kyle Forster is the Founder of RunWhen, a company pioneering the use of AI for troubleshooting mission critical applications in dev, test and production environments.

David has been developing software professionally for nearly 20 years, starting with embedded systems written in C back in 2004, and has spent that entire time learning the paradigms of different programming languages, including C++, PHP, Java, and Haskell - though more recently preferring to work with Go, Rust, and Pony.
As a professional technology magpie, David was an early adopter of cloud, containers, and cloud-native technologies. During his time as the Director of Development for a rock and metal media organization called TeamRock (now LouderSound), David was responsible for the software, infrastructure, and website during its biggest test: the unfortunate death of Lemmy Kilmister. Fortunately, due to his desire to experiment and play with new technologies, David and his team had already migrated their slow to provision virtual-machine centric infrastructure to containerised workloads running on Amazon Web Services the year prior, 2014, not long after the public launch of Docker.
As much as David enjoys writing software, scaling infrastructure, and leading teams, he quickly realised that his passion was helping others learn and be successful. David started presenting at local user groups in 2016, slowly working up to conferences, before eventually moving into a full-time Developer Advocacy position at InfluxData - where he presented and taught workshops at 42 events in 2019.
Outside of technology, David enjoys reading science fiction, drinking craft beer and whisky, and very-very-very slowly learning to play the piano."
