It’s powerful stuff … but when you combine it with observability (the ability to understand the inner workings of your complex systems and other unknown-unknowns), what you get is a supercharged, superpowered version of both.
With observability and feature flags, you and your teams get deep technical and business insights in real time about how your code is working, what changed with your last deploy, and how changes are impacting different users, apps, or groups.",,
