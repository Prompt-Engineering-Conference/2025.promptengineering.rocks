How can you mitigate?,"In this session, you'll learn about a few of the mitigation steps you can take for every Kubernetes environment which include:  - The 4C's of Kubernetes Security - SecurityContexts - Pod Security Standards - Policy Enforcement - Network Policies","Security is a tricky thing. Despite what we've seen from Hugh Jackman hacking into systems with 50 CRT monitors (who else has watched Sword?... I'm getting old), it really comes down to two things:  - Application Security - Network Security  And in each of those categories, the absolute largest method of bad actors getting into applications and systems is misconfigurations... and unfortunately, it's incredibly easy to misconfigure a Kubernetes environment.

Remember - security is about mitigating as much as possible, but you'll never be able to stop everything.","Michael Levan is a Distinguished Engineer in the Kubernetes and Security space who spends his time working with startups and enterprises around the globe on Kubernetes consulting, training, and content creation.
