One of the best places for Wasm to run is with the world's largest orchestrator, Kubernetes.
In this session, you'll learn about:
* How Wasm and Kubernetes work together.
* How to create a Wasm binary via a container image.
* How to run the Wasm binary in Kubernetes.

Don’t tell me your secrets!,"Join for an interesting talk on 'Secret Management'. We'll dive into the challenges of protecting sensitive data in dynamic, distributed environments. Learn about tools that offer secure, scalable, and reliable solutions. Don't miss this opportunity to enhance your DevOps practices!","Secret management is a crucial aspect of DevOps, as it protects sensitive data used by applications and services. Secrets can include API keys, credentials, tokens, certificates, and passwords that grant access to various resources and systems. If these secrets are compromised, attackers can exploit them to cause damage, steal information, or disrupt operations. The challenges of secret management is how to securely store, distribute, and rotate secrets in a dynamic and distributed environment. Traditional methods of hard-coding secrets in configuration files or environment variables are not secure, scalable, or reliable. Moreover, secrets need to be updated frequently to comply with security policies and regulations to prevent unauthorized access. To address these challenges, several tools and frameworks have been developed to provide secret management solutions for DevOps.These tools can help DevOps teams to implement best practices for secret management.","Michel started his career as a medical officer in the Royal Dutch Airforce, with a focus on pharma.

We compare two automated test generation approaches (LLM vs SBST), discuss open source tools & industry use cases, and provide developers with recommendations for integrating AI into their testing workflows.","Cohn’s Test Pyramid has been a foundational aspect of agile development, guiding developers in the delicate balance between unit, integration, and e2e testing. The recent surge in the adoption of AI based code generation necessitates a need to rethink the canonical form of the testing pyramid as test driven development takes on a “shift-left” approach, pushing complex integration testing to earlier in the workflow. In this talk, we start by discussing the two main automated test generation approaches in use today (LLM-based vs SBST-based) and tradeoffs between them, and then we dive into some open source generation software and current industry use-cases using AI based test generation. Finally, we address some common myths surrounding future speculation about advancements in this area, and close with informed recommendations for developers on when to consider AI based solutions for your testing workflows and which approach to use.
Key takeaways for developers:
- A practical understanding of the tradeoffs between LLM and SBST-based test generation approaches.
- Available test generation tools that can be used for your use-cases. - Recommendations for when and how to integrate automated test generation in your workflow","Hi, I’m Surbhi, currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Google in NYC.

Metrics that center the user experience gives teams focus and goals. Highlighting the metrics that matter most gives teams space to disable alerts that contribute nothing to overall customer happiness.

Automation gives us more hands to deal with more issues without taking time away from more interesting work. Machine Learning tools group alerts together and help add context when things are noisy and distracting.

These tools combined help teams tackle a common incident response problem - alert fatigue. Full Service Ownership teams looking to improve the quality of their services can experiment with their SLIs and SLOs to find the work that will benefit their systems the most while also preserving their own sanity.
