Then, everyone quickly realized that Wasm is a runtime, and because of that, it needs a place to run.

There are a ton of places where Wasm can run - locally, in serverless functions, on a VM, and even in Docker.

One of the best places for Wasm to run is with the world's largest orchestrator, Kubernetes.

In this session, you'll learn about:

* How Wasm and Kubernetes work together.
* How to create a Wasm binary via a container image.
* How to run the Wasm binary in Kubernetes.
* What runtime availability a k8s cluster needs to ensure that Wasm runs properly.",,"Michael Levan is a Distinguished Engineer in the Kubernetes and Security space who spends his time working with startups and enterprises around the globe on Kubernetes consulting, training, and content creation. He is a trainer, 4x published author, podcast host, international public speaker, CNCF Ambassador, and was part of the Kubernetes v1.28 Release Team.
