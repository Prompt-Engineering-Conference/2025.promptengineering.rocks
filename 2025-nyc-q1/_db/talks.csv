No team knows where the bodies are buried better than DevOps and for that reason they are often called on to play a key role.   When incident response is fragmented however, teams struggle to respond quickly and effectively. Once the immediate issue is resolved, gaps in visibility, accountability, and responsibility remain, leaving leaders and teams unsure of how to prevent future incidents or improve outcomes. This keynote will explore how these shortcomings emerge during and after an incident, and provide Dev leaders with practical guidance on bridging the gaps between DevOps, ITOps, ITSM, and ITIM. Learn how to break down silos, streamline the incident management process, and create a unified approach that drives efficiency, accountability, and better long-term results.",,"Phil Christianson is the Chief Product Officer at Xurrent, where he drives the strategic direction and execution of the platform roadmap, focusing on metrics-driven leadership to secure a winning market position.

Then, everyone quickly realized that Wasm is a runtime, and because of that, it needs a place to run.
There are a ton of places where Wasm can run - locally, in serverless functions, on a VM, and even in Docker.
One of the best places for Wasm to run is with the world's largest orchestrator, Kubernetes.
In this session, you'll learn about:
* How Wasm and Kubernetes work together.
* How to create a Wasm binary via a container image.
* How to run the Wasm binary in Kubernetes.
* What runtime availability a k8s cluster needs to ensure that Wasm runs properly.",,"Michael Levan is a Distinguished Engineer in the Kubernetes and Security space who spends his time working with startups and enterprises around the globe on Kubernetes consulting, training, and content creation.

Metrics that center the user experience gives teams focus and goals. Highlighting the metrics that matter most gives teams space to disable alerts that contribute nothing to overall customer happiness.

Automation gives us more hands to deal with more issues without taking time away from more interesting work. Machine Learning tools group alerts together and help add context when things are noisy and distracting.

These tools combined help teams tackle a common incident response problem - alert fatigue. Full Service Ownership teams looking to improve the quality of their services can experiment with their SLIs and SLOs to find the work that will benefit their systems the most while also preserving their own sanity. Prevent the stress and anxiety that can arise from unexpected system failures by setting clear expectations and allowing for planned responses to potential issues based on pre-agreed norms.",,

We compare two automated test generation approaches (LLM vs SBST), discuss open source tools & industry use cases, and provide developers with recommendations for integrating AI into their testing workflows.","Cohn’s Test Pyramid has been a foundational aspect of agile development, guiding developers in the delicate balance between unit, integration, and e2e testing. The recent surge in the adoption of AI based code generation necessitates a need to rethink the canonical form of the testing pyramid as test driven development takes on a “shift-left” approach, pushing complex integration testing to earlier in the workflow. In this talk, we start by discussing the two main automated test generation approaches in use today (LLM-based vs SBST-based) and tradeoffs between them, and then we dive into some open source generation software and current industry use-cases using AI based test generation. Finally, we address some common myths surrounding future speculation about advancements in this area, and close with informed recommendations for developers on when to consider AI based solutions for your testing workflows and which approach to use.

Key takeaways for developers:

* A practical understanding of the tradeoffs between LLM and SBST-based test generation approaches.
* Available test generation tools that can be used for your use-cases. - Recommendations for when and how to integrate automated test generation in your workflow","Hi, I’m Surbhi, currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Google in NYC.
