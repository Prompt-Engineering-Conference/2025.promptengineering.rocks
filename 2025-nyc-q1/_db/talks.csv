We compare two automated test generation approaches (LLM vs SBST), discuss open source tools & industry use cases, and provide developers with recommendations for integrating AI into their testing workflows.","Cohn’s Test Pyramid has been a foundational aspect of agile development, guiding developers in the delicate balance between unit, integration, and e2e testing. The recent surge in the adoption of AI based code generation necessitates a need to rethink the canonical form of the testing pyramid as test driven development takes on a “shift-left” approach, pushing complex integration testing to earlier in the workflow. In this talk, we start by discussing the two main automated test generation approaches in use today (LLM-based vs SBST-based) and tradeoffs between them, and then we dive into some open source generation software and current industry use-cases using AI based test generation. Finally, we address some common myths surrounding future speculation about advancements in this area, and close with informed recommendations for developers on when to consider AI based solutions for your testing workflows and which approach to use.
Key takeaways for developers:
- A practical understanding of the tradeoffs between LLM and SBST-based test generation approaches.
- Available test generation tools that can be used for your use-cases. - Recommendations for when and how to integrate automated test generation in your workflow","Hi, I’m Surbhi, currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Google in NYC. My background includes 7 years of experience working in Android native client development, platform engineering, performance optimization, backend architectures, and server-driven UIs all of which have involved test-driven development. My work has primarily been in Java and C++. I graduated from Brown University with a degree in Computer Science where I contributed to the department’s undergraduate teaching in data structures algorithms, focusing on making courses inclusive and collaborative and introducing unit testing and the testing pyramid paradigm to the course curriculum, which has since become a mainstay fixture. Since then, I have at Google, contributed extensively towards intern hiring, mentoring early career professionals, and helping foster inclusive team cultures. I enjoy following pro tennis, running, biking, cooking, board games, walking, eating good food, and exploring the city. Reach me at surbhimadan1995@gmail.com ."

Then, everyone quickly realized that Wasm is a runtime, and because of that, it needs a place to run.
There are a ton of places where Wasm can run - locally, in serverless functions, on a VM, and even in Docker.
One of the best places for Wasm to run is with the world's largest orchestrator, Kubernetes.
In this session, you'll learn about:
* How Wasm and Kubernetes work together.
* How to create a Wasm binary via a container image.
* How to run the Wasm binary in Kubernetes.
* What runtime availability a k8s cluster needs to ensure that Wasm runs properly.",,"Michael Levan is a Distinguished Engineer in the Kubernetes and Security space who spends his time working with startups and enterprises around the globe on Kubernetes consulting, training, and content creation.

Through real case studies, learn how we achieved 96% failure prediction accuracy, cut cooling costs by 23%, and reduced incident response times by 85%.","Join us for a data-driven exploration of AI's impact on enterprise data center operations across multiple facilities. We'll demonstrate how our AI implementations delivered concrete improvements in four key areas: predictive maintenance, resource optimization, energy management, and security. Through real-world case studies, we'll show how our ML models achieved a 47% reduction in equipment failures with 96% prediction accuracy, while our resource optimization algorithms improved utilization by 31% and cut server latency by 38%. We'll detail our cooling efficiency gains that reduced PUE from 1.6 to 1.25, resulting in 23% cost savings. The presentation will cover our security framework's achievements in threat detection (98.5% accuracy) and incident response (85% faster than manual processes), plus our neural network-based capacity planning system that reaches 96% forecasting accuracy. Drawing from implementations across facilities ranging from <1MW to >5MW, we'll share practical strategies for AI adoption in mission-critical infrastructure, including common pitfalls and their solutions.

Don’t tell me your secrets!,"Join for an interesting talk on 'Secret Management'. We'll dive into the challenges of protecting sensitive data in dynamic, distributed environments. Learn about tools that offer secure, scalable, and reliable solutions. Don't miss this opportunity to enhance your DevOps practices!","Secret management is a crucial aspect of DevOps, as it protects sensitive data used by applications and services. Secrets can include API keys, credentials, tokens, certificates, and passwords that grant access to various resources and systems. If these secrets are compromised, attackers can exploit them to cause damage, steal information, or disrupt operations. The challenges of secret management is how to securely store, distribute, and rotate secrets in a dynamic and distributed environment. Traditional methods of hard-coding secrets in configuration files or environment variables are not secure, scalable, or reliable. Moreover, secrets need to be updated frequently to comply with security policies and regulations to prevent unauthorized access. To address these challenges, several tools and frameworks have been developed to provide secret management solutions for DevOps.These tools can help DevOps teams to implement best practices for secret management.","Michel started his career as a medical officer in the Royal Dutch Airforce, with a focus on pharma.
