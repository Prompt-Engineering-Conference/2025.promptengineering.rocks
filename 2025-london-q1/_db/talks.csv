Our idea of 'good' parenting usually involves emulating others, whilst hoping we don’t do any permanent damage.

Stepping into management is remarkably similar: we emulate others, but it never feels quite right.

Fortunately, there’s a better way",,"Simon Copsey is a change consultant, and is on a mission to help organisations understand and unwind complex, cross-functional obstacles that get in the way of their staff, and reduce the ability to serve their customers.

Simon’s career has taken him from being a developer in the trenches to helping various organisations take pragmatic steps from a place of chaos and paralysis, to one where it becomes a little easier to see the wood for the trees."
,confirmed,James Eastham,1,1,Datadog,James Eastham.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-eastham/,,@plantpowerjames,,So You Want to Maintain a Reliable Event Driven System,,"Building an event-driven system is the easy part. You build producers that produce messages and consumers that consume messages, and you leverage managed services as the message channels between your systems. But what does this mean for your operations? The things that keep your systems online, your users delighted, and your pager quiet at 3 am.

In this session, you'll gain practical knowledge you can apply when building and operating event-driven systems. You'll learn how to test systems that prioritize asynchronous communication, evolve them over time, and, most importantly, observe them and recover from failures when things go wrong. This session will walk through the software development lifecycle for an actual application, and it includes the theory behind the different practices and practical things you can take away and implement in your architectures.","James Eastham is a Serverless Developer Advocate at Datadog. He has over 10 years experience in software, at all layers of the application stack.
