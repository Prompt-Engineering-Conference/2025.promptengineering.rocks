,confirmed,Michael Cote,1,1,VMware / Pivotal,Michael Cote.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcote/,,@cote,,Platform Engineering for Private Cloud,"“Platform engineering” is the art of building and managing the infrastructure that powers your applications: a mix of cloud, a handful of DevOps, a pinch of SRE, and a thick glaze of product management. While it’s “nothing new,” many organizations are just starting to practice it—and for good reason. But what happens when your platform is running on private cloud?

With around 50% of enterprise apps still running on private clouds, platform engineering for private platforms is surprisingly under-discussed. This talk dives into real-world examples and stories from large organizations tackling this challenge. The hurdles often lie in adapting platform engineering to existing IT stacks and processes—most organizations can’t simply start from scratch, nor would they want to abandon what’s currently driving revenue.

If you support your organization’s apps, platform engineering is something you’ll probably be doing soon. Come learn how your peers are navigating these challenges and share your own experiences.",,"[Michael Cote](https://cote.io/) studies how large organizations get better at building software to run better and grow their business.

But as modern software ecosystems become more complex—with microservices, serverless architectures, and global deployments—testing alone no longer suffices. It’s time to rethink Shift Left as more than just pre-release testing—it must evolve. Traditional testing strategies like Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) have been invaluable, ensuring code correctness and expected behavior. However, they miss critical aspects of real-world performance, scalability, and user experience. A passing test suite can’t guarantee an application won’t crash under peak loads or degrade due to subtle performance bottlenecks. Enter observability: the missing piece in the Shift Left equation. By integrating observability practices early in the SDLC, teams gain deep, actionable insights into how applications behave in production-like environments. Metrics, traces, and logs reveal performance slowdowns, scalability constraints, and user experience hiccups long before end users are affected.",,"Martin McLarnon is an engineer with almost 30 years experience working in many different roles within IT.

By tracking business-centric metrics, we identified issues early and resolved them before they significantly impacted users or revenue.

Real-World Cases from Experience

* Case #1: Monitoring Orders Per Minute in an e-commerce platform helped us detect a third-party payment gateway outage early.
* Case #2: Tracking Number of Support Cases per hour revealed a failure in a canary deployment, affecting a subset of app users.
* Case #3: Monitoring Subscription Renewals exposed an issue with password recovery, impacting customer retention.
Key Takeaway

SREs shouldn’t focus only on infrastructure and tech metrics. Sometimes, tracking core business metrics and spotting anomalies can uncover critical issues—often more effectively than monitoring millions of technical metrics.

Attendees will leave with practical insights and strategies to incorporate business-driven monitoring into their workflows, aligning technical operations with business success.",,"Mike Rykmas is a skilled software engineer with years of expertise in database administration, cloud computing, and IT infrastructure.

Yet, the most advanced cloud infrastructure, the most cutting-edge tools, and the most sophisticated algorithms are only as effective as the people behind them. The truth is, it is not just the technical expertise that drives successful cloud initiatives; it is the ability to communicate, collaborate, and build trust that truly sets teams apart. In this talk, I will explore why the human side of the cloud is often the missing piece in achieving transformational success.

The cloud is not just a technical platform; it is a shared space where people, ideas, and goals converge. Whether you are working on a multi-cloud strategy or deploying serverless applications, success hinges on the ability of individuals and teams to work together seamlessly. It is about understanding diverse perspectives, breaking down silos, and fostering an environment where innovation thrives. Yet, too often, organizations overlook the importance of soft skills in favor of purely technical competencies. The result? Misaligned priorities, communication breakdowns, and missed opportunities to fully leverage the power of the cloud.

Soft skills such as empathy, active listening, and conflict resolution are not just “nice to have” in cloud projects—they are essential. Imagine a scenario where a development team and an operations team have differing priorities during a cloud migration. Without clear communication and a shared understanding, this disconnect can lead to delays, inefficiencies, or worse, failure to deliver. On the other hand, when team members can articulate their needs, understand each other's challenges, and find common ground, the result is a project that runs more smoothly and achieves better outcomes.

But soft skills extend beyond team dynamics. They are also critical when engaging with stakeholders. Whether you are pitching a new cloud initiative to executives or addressing concerns from non-technical colleagues, your ability to frame ideas in ways that resonate is crucial. It is not enough to understand the technical value of what you are building; you must also communicate its impact in human terms. The most innovative cloud solutions will fall flat if their value is not clearly articulated to those who depend on them.

This talk will also explore how soft skills can enhance leadership in cloud-focused environments. In fast-paced, high-stakes projects, effective leaders need more than technical know-how; they need to inspire, motivate, and guide their teams through uncertainty. Leadership is about creating a culture where people feel empowered to take risks, share ideas, and work together to solve complex problems. It is about fostering a sense of purpose that transcends technical goals and aligns with broader organizational values.

As organizations increasingly adopt cloud technologies, the demand for professionals with strong soft skills is only growing. Employers are looking for individuals who can not only manage infrastructure and write code but also lead conversations, solve conflicts, and drive collaboration across departments. These are the qualities that turn technical experts into invaluable team players and transformational leaders.

Soft skills also play a crucial role in bridging the gap between technical teams and end-users. Cloud technologies often bring about change, which can be met with resistance or hesitation. Professionals who can communicate with empathy and clarity help reduce friction, ensuring smoother transitions and greater adoption of cloud solutions. They can demystify the technical aspects, making the benefits of the cloud accessible and relatable to all.

This talk is for anyone who wants to unlock the full potential of their cloud projects by harnessing the power of human connection. Whether you are a cloud architect, a project manager, or an IT professional, you will leave with actionable insights on how to cultivate the soft skills that matter most. From practical tips on improving communication to strategies for building trust within teams, this session will equip you to succeed in the increasingly collaborative world of the cloud.

The human side of the cloud is not a secondary concern—it is the foundation upon which all successful cloud initiatives are built. By prioritizing soft skills, you can drive innovation, improve outcomes, and create a lasting impact in your organization. Join me for this talk and discover how the key to mastering the cloud lies not just in the technology you use but in the people who bring it to life.",,"Victor Onyenagubom is a dynamic Lecturer in Cybersecurity at Teesside University London, where he develops and delivers cybersecurity modules to international master’s students, fostering an engaging and inclusive learning environment.
