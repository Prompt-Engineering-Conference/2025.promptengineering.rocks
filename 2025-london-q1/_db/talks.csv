This solution is maintained by a single team, while more than 1,500 developers seamlessly work without needing to understand the internals of the service mesh or write Kubernetes manifests.  This talk will delve into:  - Our two-year journey migrating from one service mesh to another. - Challenges in organizing ingress communication rules. - Accelerating the adoption of Mutual TLS (mTLS) and service authorization. - Testing changes within a service mesh. - Should developers be aware of the service mesh? How we’ve made it transparent to them. - The new possibilities and advantages unlocked by adopting a service mesh. - What can you expect from a service mesh at scale, and how can you choose the right one?","Igor works at Avito, the largest classified advertisement website (MAU over 50 million).

In this talk we’ll explore why DevOps is not a purely technical endeavour, what it means to apply DevOps across the whole organisation, and how you can use these ideas to deliver change where you work.","DevOps is one of those terms whose meaning varies greatly depending on the background, job role, and lived experience of those being asked, but most people would agree that it is something that applies to the development and operation of software. But at some point, DevOps outgrew this simple coming together, and so we combined other functions to get terms like ‘DevSecOps’, ‘DataOps’, ‘MLOps’ and so on. All these terms are, however, too simplistic to capture the actual essence of DevOps and the ways of working that have developed around it. However, there is no reason that these principles should only be applied to the development and operation of digital products and services. They can actually be applied across organisations as a whole to create ‘The DevOps Organisation’.
