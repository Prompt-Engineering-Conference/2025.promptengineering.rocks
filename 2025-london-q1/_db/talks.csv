,confirmed,Victor Onyenagubom,1,1,Teesside University London,Victor Onyenagubom.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-onyenagubom/,,,,The Human Side of the Cloud: Why Soft Skills Are the Key to Success,"In a world increasingly defined by complex technology and rapid innovation, it is easy to focus entirely on the technical aspects of success. Yet, the most advanced cloud infrastructure, the most cutting-edge tools, and the most sophisticated algorithms are only as effective as the people behind them. The truth is, it is not just the technical expertise that drives successful cloud initiatives; it is the ability to communicate, collaborate, and build trust that truly sets teams apart. In this talk, I will explore why the human side of the cloud is often the missing piece in achieving transformational success.

The cloud is not just a technical platform; it is a shared space where people, ideas, and goals converge. Whether you are working on a multi-cloud strategy or deploying serverless applications, success hinges on the ability of individuals and teams to work together seamlessly. It is about understanding diverse perspectives, breaking down silos, and fostering an environment where innovation thrives. Yet, too often, organizations overlook the importance of soft skills in favor of purely technical competencies. The result? Misaligned priorities, communication breakdowns, and missed opportunities to fully leverage the power of the cloud.

Soft skills such as empathy, active listening, and conflict resolution are not just “nice to have” in cloud projects—they are essential. Imagine a scenario where a development team and an operations team have differing priorities during a cloud migration. Without clear communication and a shared understanding, this disconnect can lead to delays, inefficiencies, or worse, failure to deliver. On the other hand, when team members can articulate their needs, understand each other's challenges, and find common ground, the result is a project that runs more smoothly and achieves better outcomes.

But soft skills extend beyond team dynamics. They are also critical when engaging with stakeholders. Whether you are pitching a new cloud initiative to executives or addressing concerns from non-technical colleagues, your ability to frame ideas in ways that resonate is crucial. It is not enough to understand the technical value of what you are building; you must also communicate its impact in human terms. The most innovative cloud solutions will fall flat if their value is not clearly articulated to those who depend on them.

This talk will also explore how soft skills can enhance leadership in cloud-focused environments. In fast-paced, high-stakes projects, effective leaders need more than technical know-how; they need to inspire, motivate, and guide their teams through uncertainty. Leadership is about creating a culture where people feel empowered to take risks, share ideas, and work together to solve complex problems. It is about fostering a sense of purpose that transcends technical goals and aligns with broader organizational values.

As organizations increasingly adopt cloud technologies, the demand for professionals with strong soft skills is only growing. Employers are looking for individuals who can not only manage infrastructure and write code but also lead conversations, solve conflicts, and drive collaboration across departments. These are the qualities that turn technical experts into invaluable team players and transformational leaders.

Soft skills also play a crucial role in bridging the gap between technical teams and end-users. Cloud technologies often bring about change, which can be met with resistance or hesitation. Professionals who can communicate with empathy and clarity help reduce friction, ensuring smoother transitions and greater adoption of cloud solutions. They can demystify the technical aspects, making the benefits of the cloud accessible and relatable to all.

This talk is for anyone who wants to unlock the full potential of their cloud projects by harnessing the power of human connection. Whether you are a cloud architect, a project manager, or an IT professional, you will leave with actionable insights on how to cultivate the soft skills that matter most. From practical tips on improving communication to strategies for building trust within teams, this session will equip you to succeed in the increasingly collaborative world of the cloud.

The human side of the cloud is not a secondary concern—it is the foundation upon which all successful cloud initiatives are built. By prioritizing soft skills, you can drive innovation, improve outcomes, and create a lasting impact in your organization. Join me for this talk and discover how the key to mastering the cloud lies not just in the technology you use but in the people who bring it to life.",,"Victor Onyenagubom is a dynamic Lecturer in Cybersecurity at Teesside University London, where he develops and delivers cybersecurity modules to international master’s students, fostering an engaging and inclusive learning environment.

Divine explores Sovereign DBaaS, a model putting you back in control. Learn how to build your own private DBaaS with Dapr, overcoming compliance and licensing headaches. Gain insights from real-world feedback and design considerations.","DBaaS has existed for over a decade. Since Amazon launched its Relational Database Service (RDS) in 2009, it has become one of its most popular services, and the other cloud providers followed suit. Managed DBaaS services are popular because databases are complex at scale, requiring specialized knowledge, and there is a shortage of experienced DBAs.

Though RDS and the like make managing databases easier, they create new problems ranging from data compliance issues and license instability to vendor lock-in. Hence, sovereignty is needed, not just for the data, but for its stack – infrastructure and tooling.

Divine will start this talk by elaborating on the critical problems with traditional DBaaS today, introducing the concept of Sovereign DBaaS and its benefits.

After that, Divine will discuss the actual building of a private DBaaS using Dapr, from the fundamental points you need to consider to system design considerations and what a provisional architecture will look like when developed.

Finally, Divine will wrap up by sharing feedback on building a private DBaaS from the CNCF DBaaS community and talking to database decision makers in organizations.","Divine Odazie is a Technology Evangelist at Severalnines with over 5+ years of experience in Technology and a track record in Backend Engineering, DevOps, Cloud Native and Developer Relations on a global scale.

Backend engineers are becoming more familiar with the primary signals and technologies, such as OpenTelemetry that can be used to instrument applications and diagnose issues. Yet, in the frontend world, we're behind the curve.

Join me as I dive into the tools and techniques we can use to instrument, monitor and diagnose issues in our production frontend applications. I'll cover RUM agents, and the metrics and traces they provide, how to combine them with backend tracing for a holistic picture. We'll dive into the state of client instrumentation in OpenTelemetry and what you can do now. Finally, we'll also show how Synthetic Monitoring and alerting in Observability platforms can help us be alerted to issues impacting users in the UIs we build and maintain.",,"Carly is a Developer Advocate and Manager at Elastic, based in London, UK.
