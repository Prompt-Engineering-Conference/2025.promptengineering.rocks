You build producers that produce messages and consumers that consume messages, and you leverage managed services as the message channels between your systems. But what does this mean for your operations? The things that keep your systems online, your users delighted, and your pager quiet at 3 am.

In this session, you'll gain practical knowledge you can apply when building and operating event-driven systems. You'll learn how to test systems that prioritize asynchronous communication, evolve them over time, and, most importantly, observe them and recover from failures when things go wrong. This session will walk through the software development lifecycle for an actual application, and it includes the theory behind the different practices and practical things you can take away and implement in your architectures.","James Eastham is a Serverless Developer Advocate at Datadog.
