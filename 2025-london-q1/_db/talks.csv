I'll cover the Kubernetes operator pattern, KubeBuilder, data governance, how we built our connector ecosystem, and many more.","Building a data streaming platform that can scale with your organization while maintaining developer productivity is challenging. In this talk, I'll unpack the architectural decisions and engineering challenges of building a cloud-native streaming platform from scratch using Kubernetes Operators. Through this journey - from initial design to production scale, we'll explore transforming the operator pattern into a foundational piece of our data infrastructure, powering thousands of streaming workflows daily. Beyond the technical implementation, I'll share insights about building developer experiences that scale. We will cover the architectural patterns used and the extensible connector ecosystem that enabled our platform to handle millions of daily events without changing its core design.","Elad Leev is a Staff Engineer and open-source enthusiast with over 10 years of experience managing complex production systems. He has expertise in distributed systems, databases, and data streaming technologies. Elad is using Kafka in production since 2016, and he is a strong advocate for data streaming solutions, particularly with technologies like Kafka, Flink, Debezium and Kafka Connect."
,confirmed,James Eastham,1,1,Datadog,James Eastham.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-eastham/,,@plantpowerjames,,So You Want to Maintain a Reliable Event Driven System,,"Building an event-driven system is the easy part. You build producers that produce messages and consumers that consume messages, and you leverage managed services as the message channels between your systems. But what does this mean for your operations? The things that keep your systems online, your users delighted, and your pager quiet at 3 am.

In this session, you'll gain practical knowledge you can apply when building and operating event-driven systems. You'll learn how to test systems that prioritize asynchronous communication, evolve them over time, and, most importantly, observe them and recover from failures when things go wrong. This session will walk through the software development lifecycle for an actual application, and it includes the theory behind the different practices and practical things you can take away and implement in your architectures.","James Eastham is a Serverless Developer Advocate at Datadog. He has over 10 years experience in software, at all layers of the application stack.

He has worked in front-line support, database administration, backend development and with everything from startups to some of the biggest companies in the world architecting systems using AWS technologies.

James produces content on YouTube, focused around building applications with serverless technologies using .NET, Java & Rust."

NebulOuS accomplishes substantial research contributions in the realms of cloud continuum brokerage by introducing methods and tools for enabling secure and optimal application provisioning and reconfiguration over the cloud continuum.

NebulOuS project develops a platform that seamlessly exploits edge nodes in conjunction with multi-cloud resources, to cope with the requirements posed by low latency applications. We call this kind of platform a Meta Operating System (MOS) as it works as the layer above traditional operating systems.

The NebulOuS software is published on GitHub at https://github.com/eu-nebulous under an open-source licence: Mozilla Public Licence 2.0. It extensively uses other open-source software published under permissive licences such as Apache License 2.0. Most notably, the core of deployment relies on Kubernetes, KubeVela and Knative. The solution includes the following directions of work: - Modelling methods and tools for describing the cloud continuum, application requirements, and data streams; for assuring the QoS of the provisioned services. - Efficient comparison of available offerings, using appropriate multi-criteria decision-making methods. - Addressing the security aspects emerging in the cloud continuum. - Conducting and monitoring smart contracts-based service level agreements.",,"Jan is a dedicated Java Developer and Cloud Engineer, currently advancing in his computer science degree. With over three years of involvement in the HORIZON 2020 programs, he has gained substantial experience in developing Java applications and managing cloud infrastructures. Janek's practical knowledge and hands-on approach to cloud technologies and software development make him a valuable asset. His work primarily focuses on implementing scalable cloud-native solutions and ensuring robust system performance. Janek is known for his ability to navigate complex technical challenges, a skill he continuously refines through his academic and project-based experiences."

Learn how we switched autoscalers in production, the challenges we faced along the way, and why we built a custom controller to fix broken nodes.","Is it possible to seamlessly hand over your Kubernetes cluster from one node-autoscaler to another without causing downtime — and, more importantly, should you? In this talk, we’ll dive into how adjoe accomplished this transition, tackling challenges such as scaling test environments outside working hours, navigating the release of Karpenter V1 mid-migration, and even creating a custom controller to manage broken nodes. Join to learn about the obstacles we faced and the valuable benefits we gained along the way.","Marius, a dedicated DevOps Engineer at Hamburg’s fast-growing adtech company, adjoe. Since joining over three years ago, Marius has been on a mission to enhance the reliability and scalability of our backend — an event-driven microservice architecture written in Go and powered by Kubernetes.

In this talk we’ll explore why DevOps is not a purely technical endeavour, what it means to apply DevOps across the whole organisation, and how you can use these ideas to deliver change where you work.","DevOps is one of those terms whose meaning varies greatly depending on the background, job role, and lived experience of those being asked, but most people would agree that it is something that applies to the development and operation of software. But at some point, DevOps outgrew this simple coming together, and so we combined other functions to get terms like ‘DevSecOps’, ‘DataOps’, ‘MLOps’ and so on. All these terms are, however, too simplistic to capture the actual essence of DevOps and the ways of working that have developed around it. However, there is no reason that these principles should only be applied to the development and operation of digital products and services. They can actually be applied across organisations as a whole to create ‘The DevOps Organisation’. This talk explores how DevOps principles can be taken and applied outside of the context of software development to provide better outcomes, both internally, and externally, for an organisation.","Mark has over 15 years experience in software engineering, working across the SDLC starting out as a software engineer and later transitioning into DevOps and Cloud focused roles. He has been leading Communities of Practice for around 5 years and has worked with numerous technology stacks and across a wide range of industries, including Healthcare, FinTech, and Logistics. He has worked as an AWS consultant to some of the biggest Financial and Insurance firms in the U.K. and is now the DevOps Practice Lead at RiverSafe. In this role he is responsible for leading and building a highly skilled team of DevOps experts, delivering expert services and exceptional outcomes for customers. Mark is especially passionate about serverless technology and sustainability."

Our idea of 'good' parenting usually involves emulating others, whilst hoping we don’t do any permanent damage.

Stepping into management is remarkably similar: we emulate others, but it never feels quite right.

Fortunately, there’s a better way",,"Simon Copsey is a change consultant, and is on a mission to help organisations understand and unwind complex, cross-functional obstacles that get in the way of their staff, and reduce the ability to serve their customers.
