In this session, In this session, I'll be addressing the hidden financial and technical challenges of running ML on Kubernetes, with a focus on cost optimization which is a big concern in modern MLOps environments. Kubernetes has powerful capabilities, but can become inefficient without good management, especially when it comes to resource allocation. I will go over common issues like overprovisioning, where allocating more resources than needed leads to inflated costs, and will present practical strategies to ""fine-tune"" cloud resource usage for more efficient ML operations. In my opinion one of the most overlooked aspects of ML workloads is the cost of data movement—transferring large datasets between cloud storage and compute nodes, especially during frequent model retraining. In this session, I'll share my experience and actionable techniques to optimize data flow, reduce transfer costs, and accelerate model training cycles.",,"My name is Natalie. I'm a Staff Cloud Engineer.

If I have time, I also enjoy working on building and automating various tools that help our development team be more productive and happy. What motivates me at work is the fast pace, team orientation, and creative environment, always new challenges.

When designing and implementing platforms, understanding how monitoring and observability telemetry data impacts your systems is critical to scale.","At modern cloud-fleet scale, and as systems grow more complex, the volume of telemetry data in the form of logs, metrics, and traces sent to observability (o11y) systems can quickly exceed manageable limits.   This talk dives into tried and true methods for defining and enforcing telemetry data quotas for OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collectors, based on CAP Theorem. We have been applying the principles of CAP Theorem to provide the framework for achieving better telemetry volume & distribution. Through our research & application, we'll share strategies for efficiently measuring data from multiple OTel agents, ensuring rule-based data distribution & addressing the practical implications of the CAP Theorem within telemetry pipelines for cloud native systems. By reframing CAP principles in the context of telemetry data, we'll consider trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance when scaling and managing quotas across distributed systems.","Erez Rusovsky is a seasoned entrepreneur and technology leader with extensive experience in DevOps, observability, and product innovation.
