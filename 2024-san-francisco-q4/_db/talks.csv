,keynote,Tina Huang,1,1,Harness,Tina Huang.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinahuang2/,,,,Keynote: AI and SRE: Embracing the Ultimate Frontier of Automation,"Many SREs view AI with a sense of uncertainty or even fear, worried about what it might mean for their role. But automation has always been a core principle of SRE, and AI should be seen as a leap forward in that mission—the ultimate automation frontier. For decades, we’ve sought to automate repetitive tasks and streamline operations, only to encounter fragile, incomplete solutions. AI offers the potential to overcome those limitations, tackling complex tasks that have long resisted automation. Importantly, AI doesn’t replace the human element in SRE; it enhances it. By eliminating the toil of manual, repetitive work, AI allows SREs to focus on higher-level strategic thinking, creative problem-solving, and driving innovation. In essence, AI helps bring humanity back into the role, empowering SREs to do what they do best—keeping systems reliable, resilient, and ready for the future.",,"Tina Huang is a VP of Product and Engineering at Harness. Previously, she was the founder and CTO of Transposit, an AI-powered incident management platform. Tina advocates for a human-centric approach to solving complex engineering challenges, focusing on leveraging AI to augment human capabilities rather than replace them.
Tina began her career at Apple, where she designed and built APIs for the company’s application framework. As one of Google’s early engineers, she worked on the Blogger team and was instrumental in re-architecting the Google News frontend. At Twitter, she led the architecture, scaling, and operation of the company’s notification platform and also contributed to the developer productivity and build tools team. These experiences fueled her passion for enhancing DevOps and optimizing engineering workflows.
Tina holds a degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She also studied humanities at the University of Chicago, shaping her perspective on human-technology interaction."

Overall, the idea of Platform Engineering isn’t new, but what's new is the path it's taking.

Because of that, we need a production-ready approach to get Platform Engineering right without creating more tech debt.","How much hype is there around Platform Engineering? A lot.

Overall, the idea of Platform Engineering isn’t new, but what's new is the path it's taking.

Because of that, we need a production-ready approach to get Platform Engineering right without creating more tech debt.

In this session, you’ll learn from theory to hands-on how to create a proper platform. It will contain:

1. The underlying platform (Kubernetes)
2. Platform capabilities (various open-source tools from monitoring and observability to GitOps and more)
3. Platform interaction/interface (how engineers using the platform that Platform Engineers create for them interact with it)

First, we'll talk about the various details that all engineers will need to know to create and configure a proper, production-ready Kubernetes cluster that works with Platform Engineering.

Next, we'll dive into the capabilities that will exist on the Kubernetes cluster in the Platform Engineering environment. These capabilities can be anything from GitOps to monitoring to cost and resource optimization. It all depends on what the engineers need (the engineers using the platform)

Lastly, you'll learn how an end-user (the engineer using a Platform Engineering environment) can interact with it. Is it an IDP? A CLI? Another automated solution?

You’ll see everything from Kubernetes to Crossplane to Backstage and everything in between. You’ll also learn how to think about Platform Engineering as a whole when it comes to using Kubernetes as your underlying platform.","Michael Levan is a Distinguished Engineer in the Kubernetes and Security space who spends his time working with startups and enterprises around the globe on Kubernetes consulting, training, and content creation.

,confirmed,Kiran Gollu,1,1,Oodle.ai,Kiran Gollu.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirangollu/,,,,New approach to metrics observability for the cloud era: cut costs and complexity with serverless and S3,"In this talk, we will talk about lessons learnt from taking a new first principles approach to metrics observability to achieve order of magnitude cost-efficiency and simplicity. Through eliminating disks and egress costs completely with AZ-aware architecture, you can truly achieve limitless scale and zero management overhead. By making an infrastructure primitive 10x cheaper, we can truly unlock the new use cases of metrics observability. The columnar based storage engine architecture allows you to send any cardinality (customer-id, request-id, user-id, pod-id, camera-id etc). Most observability tools downsample metrics (for 1-min or 5 min or 1 hour) depending on how the old data is. In this talk, we will cover how we can retain high fidelity data all the time with no downsampling at all while being cost-efficient. ",,"Kiran Gollu is the Co-founder/CEO of Oodle.ai. Previously, he was head of cloud platform engineering at Rubrik (NYSE: RBRK), when he was responsible for observability, distributed databases, reliability/costs engineering and developer experience while they were scaling from <5M to 600M in ARR. He was also co-founder of YC backed observability startup, and was an early engineer of AWS S3 and DynamoDB."
