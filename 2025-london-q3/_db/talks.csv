,confirmed,Dave McAllister,1,1,NGINX,Dave McAllister.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/davemc/,,dwmcallister,,15 NGINX Metrics to Monitor,"Let's take a look at some of the basic NGINX metrics to monitor and what they indicate. We start with the application layer and move down through process, server, hosting provider, external services, and user activity. With these metrics, you get coverage for active and incipient problems with NGINX",,"Currently providing technical evangelism for NGINX, Dave works with DevOps, developers and architects to understand the advantages of modern microservice architectures and orchestration to solve large-scale distributed systems challenges, especially with open  source and  its innovation. Dave has been a champion for open systems and open source from the early days of Linux, through open distributed file systems like XFS, GFS, and GlusterFS to today's world of clouds and containers. He often speaks on topics such as the real-world issues associated with emerging software architectures and practices, on open source software and on creating new technology companies. 

Dave has spoken on technical topics like distributed request tracing, modern monitoring practices, open sources projects from both corporations and foundation views, and  on how open source innovations powers todays world.

Dave was named as one of the top ten pioneers in open source by Computer Business Review, having cut his teeth on Linux and compilers before the phrase ""open source"" was coined. Well versed in trivia, he won a Golden Penguin in 2002.  When he's not  talking, you can find him hiking with his trusty camera, trying to keep up with his wife.

This session unpacks the concept’s history and role in ensuring system resilience. We’ll look at some of the approaches to chaos engineering, before looking at Chaos Engineering as a Service with Amazon’s Fault Injection Service.

You’ll leave with insights into crafting and running Fault Injection Service experiment templates, plus a live demo looking at how we can now test serverless code in AWS with Chaos engineering.",,"Starting out in a very traditional background in the data-centres of the fabled M4 corridor, Simon eventually realised it was time to give up on the problems of manually babysitting servers, racks and UPS's and migrated to the Cloud (and in the process, the Scottish Highlands) and now works to enable clients to transition their workloads, processes and swag requirements to the same route.

Simon is a member of the AWS Community builder program, and these days enjoys coaching and mentoring as much getting hands-on with code, automation and head-scratching."

This talk dives into the forensic side of container security. We’ll explore how to analyze container images using Syft (SBOM generation), Grype (vulnerability scanning), and Trivy (multi-purpose scanner). Learn how to detect hidden risks, trace vulnerabilities back to their source, and build a repeatable forensic workflow that strengthens your DevSecOps pipeline. This isn’t just static analysis—it’s detective work for containers.",,"Hello, I'm Mert Polat.

I'm currently working as an Cloud and Platform Engineer at Sufle. I started my career as a Jr. DevOps Engineer at Zip Turkey, where I gained extensive experience in Infrastructure and DevOps domains. At Duzce MEKATEK, I worked in the software team for an autonomous vehicle project and took on a leadership role. Additionally, I honed my skills in technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible during a DevOps internship at Formica.

I am passionate about technology and knowledge sharing, so I write various articles for @DevopsTurkiye and @Bulut Bilişimciler publications on Medium.

I graduated from Duzce University with a degree in Computer Programming, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems at Anadolu University.

,confirmed,Amit Kushwaha,1,1,SambaNova Systems,Amit Kushwaha.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-kushwaha28/,,,,Empowering Developers through Open-Source AI,"In the ever evolving AI landscape, organizations are faced with the choice between open-source versus closed-source models. While many developers find it easier to get started in the closed source ecosystem, they quickly realize it is ultimately more expensive, inefficient, and doesn’t have the security and controls required for their applications. Alternatively, open source models have quickly caught up to their closed counterparts and now deliver a cheaper and just as accurate solution that provides organizations with the security they need to run their operations.

In addition, the pace of the open source community is iterating at speeds that are beyond belief and not only improving the accuracy of these models, but making them run even faster, especially on hardware that is better suited for AI beyond the GPU. With new open source models dropping every week and an active community fine-tuning even better versions daily, open source is making AI a commodity, with a wide range of cloud services for developers to choose from that make it even easier for them to use.

Join Amit Kushwaha, Director of AI Engineering, SambaNova, as he breaks down for attendees the advantages of open-source models, why they are critical for fast product iteration, and how organizations can use them to tap into the best minds globally, accelerate their pace of innovation, and position themselves to shape industry standards while continuously advancing enterprise-grade solutions.",,"Amit Kushwaha is the Director of AI Engineering at SambaNova Systems, leading the development and implementation of AI solutions that leverage SambaNova's differentiated hardware. Previously, as Principal Data Scientist at ExxonMobil, he led the organization’s digital transformation efforts, driving the strategy and execution of a multi-million dollar AI/ML portfolio that fostered innovation and enhanced operational efficiency at scale.

Passionate about harnessing technology to solve complex challenges, Amit specializes in developing innovative, business-focused solutions at the intersection of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and computer simulations. He holds a Ph.D. in Engineering from Stanford University."
