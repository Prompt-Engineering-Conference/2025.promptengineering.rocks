This keynote explores the vital role IaC plays in ensuring seamless, scalable operations, with a special focus on how SRE teams can enforce best practices without falling into the trap of bottlenecks and manual interventions.

Drawing an analogy to the engineering of a dam, we will dive into how SRE teams can supervise IaC deployments effectively—just as a dam controls water flow—by unifying deployment strategies, ensuring consistency, and avoiding system leaks. The key to maintaining control lies in formatting IaC into reusable blueprints that promote cloud-agnostic solutions, while preserving critical data streams between these blueprints.

But supervision alone isn't enough. To truly prevent leaks, we must introduce and enforce policies that guide deployments, monitor changes, and ensure compliance. By applying these policies at every stage of the deployment pipeline and carefully monitoring each change, SRE teams can create a safe, reliable stream of infrastructure updates. With the right tools and a culture that avoids bottleneck centralization, the potential for scale becomes limitless.

This keynote will unpack how to implement seamless IaC policy enforcement, ensuring secure, scalable infrastructure that can meet the demands of any organization, without the need for constant firefighting.",,
