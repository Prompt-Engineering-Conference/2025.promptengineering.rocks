This talk provides strategies for building adaptive incident response programs that work in complex, real-world incidents.","How many of us have walked away from a retrospective where “update X playbook” accounted for the bulk of the post-incident learning? As we establish and evolve our incident response programs, playbooks are a useful tool to document information and build consistency. But they also can easily become a dumping ground for rigid process and oversimplified approaches that don’t work in the ambiguous and complex real world incidents we experience. 

In this talk, I’ll break down three pillars for building incident response programs that build consistency and alignment while leaving room for judgment and agility. 

Pillar 1: Severity Levels (How to establish severity levels that reflect your business priorities)
Pillar 2: Heuristics (Mental shortcuts for ambiguous decision-making)
Pillar 3: Tooling (Eliminating toil to leave room for the important decisions)","Ashley Sawatsky is an expert in incident management and communication, with a focus on the SaaS world.

Yet this data can offer vital insights to sail smoothly. This session will explore strategies to avoid drowning, improving DevEx, and more.","The cloud-native ecosystem has grown exponentially in the last few years, as has the complexity of the distributed architectures being built. In a context where keeping up with technology requires a substantial amount of computational power and data, monitoring our cloud-native applications has become a constant struggle against the storm.

The ever-increasing volume of traces, metrics, events, and logs generated by our systems is a double-edged sword: on one hand, if not managed correctly, becoming a distraction from needed insights. On the other hand, if approached with care and thought, providing organizations the chance to sail calm cloud-native seas.
In this session, we will discover how to avoid drowning in the sea of monitoring data, instead understanding how to provide insights while using only what is needed. We will explore the emerging scenarios on the horizon, abandoning the oars and testing the waters of artificial intelligence as it applies to our observability use cases.

We will discuss how to leverage monitoring data, conversational DevEx, and anomaly prediction, among other topics, in this talk.","Eric is Chronosphere's Director Evangelism.
