,confirmed,Renato Losio,1,1,Funambol,Renato Losio.png,,,,,Things Fall Apart: Navigating Managed Databases for Over a Decade as a Non-DBA,"Learn to navigate database benchmarks wisely! From crashing managed instances to skyrocketing storage costs, I'll share hard-earned lessons from a decade of managing production databases on the cloud without DBA expertise.","I triggered storage autoscaling during maintenance, crashed my first managed instance on ARM due to a suboptimal configuration, and ran out of IOPS multiple times. While attempting to autosmart the automated backups, my storage costs skyrocketed, surpassing any other expenses associated with the instance. Sometimes things fall apart, and sometimes I succeed. I experimented with various methods to optimize the storage of fragmented tables. Here are a few lessons from managing dozens of production databases for over a decade, without DBA expertise.","Renato has extensive experience as a cloud architect, tech lead, and cloud services specialist. He lives in Berlin and works remotely as a principal cloud architect. His primary areas of interest include cloud services and relational databases. He is an editor at InfoQ and a recognized AWS Data Hero. "
