From crashing managed instances to skyrocketing storage costs, I'll share hard-earned lessons from a decade of managing production databases on the cloud without DBA expertise.","I triggered storage autoscaling during maintenance, crashed my first managed instance on ARM due to a suboptimal configuration, and ran out of IOPS multiple times. While attempting to autosmart the automated backups, my storage costs skyrocketed, surpassing any other expenses associated with the instance. Sometimes things fall apart, and sometimes I succeed. I experimented with various methods to optimize the storage of fragmented tables. Here are a few lessons from managing dozens of production databases for over a decade, without DBA expertise.","Renato has extensive experience as a cloud architect, tech lead, and cloud services specialist. He lives in Berlin and works remotely as a principal cloud architect. His primary areas of interest include cloud services and relational databases.

,confirmed,Michael Cote,1,1,VMware / Pivotal,Michael Cote.png,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelcote/,,@cote,,Platform Engineering for Private Cloud,"“Platform engineering” is the art of building and managing the infrastructure that powers your applications: a mix of cloud, a handful of DevOps, a pinch of SRE, and a thick glaze of product management. While it’s “nothing new,” many organizations are just starting to practice it—and for good reason. But what happens when your platform is running on private cloud?

With around 50% of enterprise apps still running on private clouds, platform engineering for private platforms is surprisingly under-discussed. This talk dives into real-world examples and stories from large organizations tackling this challenge. The hurdles often lie in adapting platform engineering to existing IT stacks and processes—most organizations can’t simply start from scratch, nor would they want to abandon what’s currently driving revenue.

If you support your organization’s apps, platform engineering is something you’ll probably be doing soon. Come learn how your peers are navigating these challenges and share your own experiences.",,"[Michael Cote](https://cote.io/) studies how large organizations get better at building software to run better and grow their business.
