While SREs can follow the best practices such as setting up the SLOs and auto recovery systems as much as possible, the P0 and P1 outages require the developers to join the forces and recover the services in the quickest time possible. Efficient collaboration between SREs and Developers is found to be crucial in achieving successful incident resolution outcomes. This talk focuses on the typical challenges faced at both the Developer and the SRE teams in keeping the communication and technical knowledge sharing to the best of their ability. This talk also discusses some modern solutions such as measuring and improving the Incident Response Readiness. SREs will walk away with new insights on efficient developer collaboration.",,

We really want systems that withstand unavoidable failures.  Abstractly, we understand that.  In this talk, Steve presents concepts like spanning failure domains and using generic mitigations, as well as introducing a lab environment where teams can experiment with these directly and a community where we can discuss it all, memes and all.",,

,confirmed,Ian Eyberg,1,1,NanoVMs,Ian Eyberg.png,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianeyberg/,,,,Tools and Best Practices from Running Unikernels in Prod for a Few Years,"Unikernels have been running in production for years now and that
experience has produced a set of new tools, best practices and
workflows from that
experience.

In this talk come hear about how and why your peers have been pushing
unikernels to prod and how new methods have been established. Whether
it's cloud specific monitoring, accessing GPU resources for ML
workloads or applying security policies that Linux workloads can't we'll
show you how companies, large and small, have been heavily investing in
unikernel deployment.",,
,confirmed,Ohad Maislish,1,1,Env0,Ohad Maislish.png,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ohadmaislish/,,@DevOpsOhad,,The IaC Tooling Face-off for Modern Cloud Native SRE Practices,"With Infrastructure as Code (IaC) becoming the de facto way we manage our infrastructure today, a lot of excellent tools have become widely adopted that each have a different set of strengths. In this talk, we'd like to take a look at the evolution of the IaC landscape over the past decade and where we're heading, with a focus on Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and modern cloud-native operations challenges.
We'll examine some of the biggest SRE and operations challenges through the lens of IaC, including disaster recovery, security, cost optimization, performance tuning, and even where complexity factors in when choosing your tooling of choice. While many teams have already selected their IaC tooling, we may also like to consider migration and integration of multiple tools for different use cases and stacks.
In this interactive talk, we'll allow you to decide which tools we explore - from CDK to Pulumi, Terraform, OpenTofu, Helm, ArgoCD - to learn about how they stack up versus modern cloud-native SRE challenges. ",,"Ohad Maislish is the CEO and co-founder of env0 and part of the founding team for the OpenTofu project. Before env0, Ohad was the CEO and founder of Arno Software, a cloud infrastructure services company, and Capester, a startup that empowered citizens in smart cities worldwide. Over the course of this career, Ohad has also served in different technical and management roles at Ravello Systems, eToro, and VMware. He was also the youngest developer at Microsoft Israel at the age of 17, after starting his bachelor's degree at the age of 14."

When it comes to latency across distributed systems, it can be hard to pinpoint where exactly the issue lies. To add to this, business demands drive where we run our workloads today - whether on-premises, cloud or hybrid environments - to enhance agility, reduce cost or risk, but often blurring our view into the health of our systems across these disjoint environments.

Clock synchronization in distributed systems is key for identifying the true culprit when it comes to latency. In this session, I’ll demystify the building blocks for synchronizing clocks across distributed systems. I’ll go over protocols to date (NTP, PTP, PPS), their pros and cons, and best practices such as slewing clocks. I’ll dive into an algorithm that achieves higher precision clock synchronization at scale. Using this, we gain visibility into useful metrics such as one way delays, which gives us the ability to monitor response times and improve performance for our end users.

The session is targeted for SRE’s, infrastructure, and platform teams who are looking to gain a deeper understanding of how to improve response times for workloads with high precision clock synchronization across distributed systems deployed on-premises, in the cloud, multi-cloud, or hybrid environments.",,"Lerna is a Senior Solutions Engineer at Clockwork Systems where she helps customers meet their performance goals as well as regulatory reporting objectives with software solutions built upon Clockwork.io’s foundational clock synchronization research.
Prior to this, she was an AWS Senior Solutions Architect serving Global Financial Services customers for 3 years.  Before that, Lerna spent 17 years as an infrastructure engineer in large financial services companies working on authentication systems, distributed caching, and multi region deployments using IaC and CI/CD to name a few.  In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, sight seeing and backyard astronomy."
