,a keynote,Uma Mukkara,1,1,Harness,Uma Mukkara.png,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/uma-mukkara/,,@Uma_Mukkara,,Keynote: Increasing the collaboration between SREs and Developers for the best outcomes on Incident Management,"SREs have been at the forefront of Incident management when it comes to recovering the services during the outages. While SREs can follow the best practices such as setting up the SLOs and auto recovery systems as much as possible, the P0 and P1 outages require the developers to join the forces and recover the services in the quickest time possible. Efficient collaboration between SREs and Developers is found to be crucial in achieving successful incident resolution outcomes. This talk focuses on the typical challenges faced at both the Developer and the SRE teams in keeping the communication and technical knowledge sharing to the best of their ability. This talk also discusses some modern solutions such as measuring and improving the Incident Response Readiness. SREs will walk away with new insights on efficient developer collaboration.",,

We really want systems that withstand unavoidable failures. Abstractly, we understand that. In this talk, Steve presents concepts like spanning failure domains and using generic mitigations, as well as introducing a lab environment where teams can experiment with these directly and a community where we can discuss it all, memes and all.",,
,a keynote,Ruchir Jha,1,1,Cardinal,Ruchir Jha.png,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruchirpjha/,,@RuchirJhaOG,,Keynote: Redefining Observability: Cost-Free Cardinality,"In Observability, Cardinality often gets the short end of the stick due to high costs. This forces engineers to minimize its use. However, SREs, who need to identify business impact quickly, suffer the most from this limitation because of misaligned incentives between developers & SREs. Cardinality reveals crucial business dimensions, linking technical metrics to business outcomes. Imagine if cost wasn't a concern and cardinality was basically free, you would now start seeing advanced tools emerge that could do the slicing on behalf of engineers. In this keynote, we will explore what this evolution in troubleshooting UX could look like?",,"Ruchir is the co-founder and CEO of Cardinal, which helps engineers view machine data through a business lens. In his previous life, he spent 7 years as a Lead Engineer on Netflix's Observability team, where he built petabyte-scale Observability products that are used daily by thousands of Netflix engineers."

Whether it's cloud-specific monitoring, accessing GPU resources for ML workloads, or applying security policies that Linux workloads can't, we'll show you how companies, large and small, have been heavily investing in unikernel deployment.",,
,confirmed,Sebastian Kurzynowski,1,1,Codejet,Sebastian Kurzynowski.png,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-k-799371126/,,@Codejetai,,TDD: Are you sure about that?,"Test-Driven Development (TDD) gives you the peace of mind to sleep well, knowing your code is robust and reliable. By writing tests before the implementation, you ensure that each change meets the requirements and works as intended, reducing the anxiety of unexpected bugs. TDD also enhances the requirements stage, as it forces clear, precise specifications, leading to a more predictable and controlled development process.",,"Sebastian is the CTO and Co-founder of Codejet. With 8 years of experience as a software architect and lecturer, he has worked at companies like Goldman Sachs, where he played a key role in developing Marcus.com. He also contributed to Stageclip.com and AndroidPolice.com. Outside of work, Sebastian enjoys Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and motorcycles."

,confirmed,Lerna Ekmekcioglu,1,1,Clockwork Systems,Lerna Ekmekcioglu.png,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/lerna/,,@lerna_,,Rock around the clock (synchronization): Improve performance for end users with high precision time!,"Is the app slow or the network lagging? When it comes to latency across distributed systems, it can be hard to pinpoint where exactly the issue lies. To add to this, business demands drive where we run our workloads today - whether on-premises, cloud or hybrid environments - to enhance agility, reduce cost or risk, but often blurring our view into the health of our systems across these disjoint environments.
Clock synchronization in distributed systems is key for identifying the true culprit when it comes to latency. In this session, I’ll demystify the building blocks for synchronizing clocks across distributed systems. I’ll go over protocols to date (NTP, PTP, PPS), their pros and cons, and best practices such as slewing clocks. I’ll dive into an algorithm that achieves higher precision clock synchronization at scale. Using this, we gain visibility into useful metrics such as one way delays, which gives us the ability to monitor response times and improve performance for our end users.
The session is targeted for SRE’s, infrastructure, and platform teams who are looking to gain a deeper understanding of how to improve response times for workloads with high precision clock synchronization across distributed systems deployed on-premises, in the cloud, multi-cloud, or hybrid environments.",,"Lerna is a Senior Solutions Engineer at Clockwork Systems where she helps customers meet their performance goals as well as regulatory reporting objectives with software solutions built upon Clockwork.io’s foundational clock synchronization research.
Prior to this, she was an AWS Senior Solutions Architect serving Global Financial Services customers for 3 years. Before that, Lerna spent 17 years as an infrastructure engineer in large financial services companies working on authentication systems, distributed caching, and multi region deployments using IaC and CI/CD to name a few. In her spare time, she enjoys hiking, sight seeing and backyard astronomy."
,confirmed,Ohad Maislish,1,1,Env0,Ohad Maislish.png,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ohadmaislish/,,@DevOpsOhad,,The IaC Tooling Face-off for Modern Cloud Native SRE Practices,"With Infrastructure as Code (IaC) becoming the de facto way we manage our infrastructure today, a lot of excellent tools have become widely adopted that each have a different set of strengths. In this talk, we'd like to take a look at the evolution of the IaC landscape over the past decade and where we're heading, with a focus on Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and modern cloud-native operations challenges.
We'll examine some of the biggest SRE and operations challenges through the lens of IaC, including disaster recovery, security, cost optimization, performance tuning, and even where complexity factors in when choosing your tooling of choice. While many teams have already selected their IaC tooling, we may also like to consider migration and integration of multiple tools for different use cases and stacks.
In this interactive talk, we'll allow you to decide which tools we explore - from CDK to Pulumi, Terraform, OpenTofu, Helm, ArgoCD - to learn about how they stack up versus modern cloud-native SRE challenges.",,"Ohad Maislish is the CEO and co-founder of env0 and part of the founding team for the OpenTofu project.
